In this newly created role, Ayers will develop and manage all SME activities associated with additive manufacturing.\n\"Around the world, additive manufacturing is changing the way companies design and manufacture products,\" said Debbie Holton, SME managing director of industry strategy and events. \"With the addition of Kevin to SME, we\u0027ll be able to even better serve the additive manufacturing and 3D printing industry, as he brings a wealth of knowledge and will be able to identify even more opportunities where SME can lend its expertise and resources.\"\nAyers joins SME after 30 years with the FBI in its manufacturing lab, and has been an active member and volunteer leader with SME\u0027s Rapid Technologies \u0026 Additive Manufacturing Community, as well as SME\u0027s RAPID event. He will also serve on the Governance Board of America Makes and is active in the Additive Manufacturing Users Group.\nAdditive manufacturing is not a new area for SME; for nearly 25 years, SME\u0027s RAPID event has been the authority on 3D printing. The event was developed by SME members who wanted an annual forum to learn and share additive manufacturing knowledge and best practices, and buy and sell related equipment and services. These members built a community of like- minded professional with whom they have grown their skills, developed their network and advanced their businesses.\nIn addition, to validate the knowledge of those working in additive manufacturing, SME, in cooperation with the Milwaukee School of Engineering and America Makes, have strategically defined the additive manufacturing body of knowledge with a review course and exam. This serves as the basis for the Additive Manufacturing Certificate Program, which is offered at several SME events, including RAPID. The 2014 RAPID event is slated for June 9 to 12 in Detroit.\nSME connects all those who are passionate about making things that improve our world. As a nonprofit organization, SME has served practitioners, companies, educators, government and communities across the manufacturing spectrum for more than 80 years. Through its strategic areas of events, media, membership, training and development, and the SME Education Foundation, SME is uniquely dedicated to advancing manufacturing by addressing both knowledge and skill needs for industry.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://additivemanufacturingtoday.com/sme-announces-new-manager-of-additive-manufacturing-and-3d-printing","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"SME Announces New Manager of Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"cnc milling","x":4517.27001953125,"y":-702.12890625,"id":"624","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"67","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"5","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"14","initial_node_score":"0.4645701861009002","real_tf_idf":"1.555","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":20.0},{"label":"desktop engineering","x":-1468.634521484375,"y":2236.697509765625,"id":"260","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"6","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"18","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"3","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"16","initial_node_score":"0.49598403135314584","real_tf_idf":"2.449","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(186,92,0)","size":20.0},{"label":"london","x":508.8271484375,"y":5405.8173828125,"id":"528","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"54","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"32","initial_node_score":"2.0170955257490277","real_tf_idf":"3.963","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_Aachen Center for 3D Printing at RapidTech 2016: Additive Manufacturing Processes for Medium-Size Companies","x":4645.4423828125,"y":-877.1524047851562,"id":"1122","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"79","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Nearly 4000 attendees from 15 countries were on hand for last year\u0027s RapidTech exhibition in Erfurt. This year, the organizers have significantly expanded the exhibition space while also extending the event by an additional day. Through the FabCon 3.D and RapidTech exhibitions as well as the RapidTech specialist conference with 700 participants (2015), they are targeting not only industrial users of additive manufacturing but also startups and creatives in the 3D printing community.\nExperts from the Aachen Center for 3D Printing, a joint project of the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology ILT and Aachen University of Applied Sciences, will again be on hand for the event. The project partners aim to provide small and medium- sized enterprises with easy access to the entire additive manufacturing (AM) process chain. To this end, they are offering training and further education initiatives in addition to consultation, hands- on training and joint projects.\nAachen University\u0027s FabBus is a converted double- decker bus with eight training stations and twelve 3D printers on board. Located on the edge of Hall 2 next to the FabCon 3.D Forum, the FabBus is set to be quite an eye- catcher. The Aachen experts take the bus to customers, where employees from a wide range of manufacturing sectors can try out this technology. In addition to the training stations, the bus also features fully equipped design workstations and a variety of 3D printers for polymers.\nThis allows customers to observe and discuss all stages of additive manufacturing. From additive- friendly design to additive manufacturing, rework and quality analysis, the Aachen Center for 3D Printing offers its full range of expertise along the additive process chain. The center also offers programs for people to train as \"Additive Manufacturing Designer\" or \"Additive Manufacturing Specialist.\"\nAside from the training and further education of employees, capital investments in production systems represent the greatest barrier to entry in additive manufacturing. The FabBus has already succeeded in lowering these hurdles, yet the acquisition costs for production systems, particularly those for processing metallic materials, remain high.\nAnd this is exactly the point of focus for a new project initiated by the Aachen Center for 3D Printing - the specialists are developing a 3D printer for metallic materials for under 10,000 euros!\nCost structures also play an important role at the RapidTech specialist conference. On Tuesday, June 14, two experts from Aachen will be discussing \"Machine- Specific Cost Drivers in Additive Manufacturing Using Laser Melting\" (Johannes Schrage, Chair for Laser Technology LLT at RWTH Aachen University) as well as \"Increasing Build- up Rates Using High- Power Selective Laser Melting for Ti6Al4V Material\" (Maximilian Schniedenharn, Fraunhofer ILT).\nWith around 700 participants last year, the conference is one of the largest specialist events for additive processes in Europe. Split into a user convention and ten different expert forums, it provides participants with an overview of the current state of scientific research and offers user forums with topics ranging from \"additive contract manufacturing\" to \"aviation\".","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en/press/press-releases/press-release-2016/press_release_20160525.html","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Aachen

according to Terry Wohlers, the new norm for 3D printing is big\nHooray for passing the inflection point!\nForecast for sales of 3D printing products and services worldwide to $7.3 billion in 2016,\nwhile in 2018 it will be $12.7 billion, and in 2020, the market is expected to reach $21.2 billion.\n- Terry Wohlers, (The Wohlers Report 2015)\nFor 2016, according to Terry Wohlers, the \"new norm\" for 3D printing is big, as in:\nAlcoa investing $60 million in additive manufacturing and 3D printing methods and materials.\nAutodesk\u0027s $100 million Spark Investment Fund full swing.\nGE to open $32 million R\u0026D facility in Pittsburgh called the Center for Additive Manufacturing Advancement.\nMichelin and Fives collaborating on a $27.2 million investment involving the creation of a new company and metal AM.\nThe state of New York investing $125 million in a 3D printing facility in partnership with Norsk Titanium.\nThe new tool gets newer\nThe best - maybe the only - economic and mechanical analog to additive manufacturing is desktop printing. Both are additive processes, and to date, both have been primarily communication tools.\nDesigners employ additive manufacturing to give form to their ideas. That will always be the case, but this technology is quickly moving to an industrial scale as techniques, materials and systems mature.\nOne of the enticing promises of the technology is the ability to do better than just- in- time parts delivery, where parts never sit on shelves waiting to be assembled.\nA significant link in the supply chain would disappear, saving money as well as time. Quality control for parts would become an internal matter and, presumably, improve. Even air quality could improve (if marginally) in an additive- manufacturing world, which would require fewer delivery vehicles.\nThere\u0027s also the hope that the technology will usher in circular manufacturing, in which printed goods are broken down for reprinting. In an age of growing scarcity of raw materials coinciding with the urgent need to minimize costs, additive manufacturing could have a significant impact on bottom lines.\nBuoying industrial growth have been desktop and consumer systems, generally referred to as 3D printing and costing less than $5,000, which arrived almost in sync with a DIY, or \"maker,\" culture of people building their own electronics, toys and parts. This has raised the profile of additive manufacturing among investors of all kinds.\nCollapse in confidence\nGiven all of this positive energy, it is not surprising that investors would want in. Sentiment on Wall St. bubbled into full- on hype by 2013, and early in 2014, money fled the vicinity.\nQuestions that sparked the collapse in confidence are still being asked. When, if ever, will additive manufacturing scale up (i.e. print faster)? Which giants besides Hewlett- Packard Development Co. are going to enter this market? How long before printer hardware is the commodity and the media - primarily resins and powdered metals - are the revenue generators?\nManufacturing CEOs buying into the concept face their own questions. How will their infrastructure change? The floor area freed from finished inventory would be replaced by a similar volume required by raw printing materials, for example. Processes involved in receiving, storing and distributing parts could be replaced by those required by printing materials and workstations.\nThen there are lesser- discussed worries about workplace and environmental safety. Exuberant green claims to the contrary, there are concerns about fumes from additive manufacturing, and early planet- friendly claims look less virtuous. And two popular materials, aluminum and titanium, are highly combustible as powders.\nYou\u0027ll see a different type of machining?\nThe near- term reality is that there still are some issues to iron out, but opportunities abound. Today\u0027s slow builds might frustrate mass manufacturers, but low- volume, custom production is well suited for small- scale, flexible lines making value- added parts and end products. GE Aviation is making tens of thousands of copies of a small but critical jet- engine part that will deliver outsized results for airlines, for example.\n\"I actually see additive as producing situations where you?re going to have higher- skilled positions that companies are going to need to fill, both on the technician level, and the engineering and design level,\" Greg Morris, who leads the GE Aviation team, told Business Insider.\n\"And I frankly think you\u0027ll see a different type of machining that will challenge the current state of machining, meaning you\u0027ll get complex parts that a machinist will have to work with versus starting with a block of material. So you\u0027re not replacing machinists; you\u0027re just asking them to learn a little different skill set of what they start with and work with.\"\nIndustries active in additive manufacturing today include aircraft, bio- medical, medical technology, dental and electronics. A good indication of the technology\u0027s maturation is its ability to deliver in uncompromising environments. Today, printers are operating out at sea with the U.S. Navy, in Afghanistan with the Army and in orbit aboard the International Space Station.\nA higher degree of automation for self- correction, lower prices for hardware, software and media, are combining to make additive manufacturing a comparatively solid investment opportunity.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/manufacturing/actually_making_things_3d_printing_for_2016/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Actually

Class":"0","top_articles":"55","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Industrial 3D metal printing or additive manufacturing is growing rapidly. Even for series production in aerospace, automotive, medical and high tech systems parts and subassemblies are 3d printed. Light weighting, mass customization, reduction of lead time and improved performance drive the adoption across industries. Crucial in the success of these innovative applications is the ability of the designer to \u0027design for additive manufacturing\u0027 and maximize the possibilities this new production technology has to offer. Apply the features that make this technology unique: thin walls, honeycomb structures, form free channels in the product, integration of functions and personalisation.\nIn order to grow the number of examples and inspire many other industries to develop dedicated applications for industrial 3D printing, Additive Industries is presenting the third edition of the Additive World Design for Additive Manufacturing Challenge. Competing in two categories, both professionals and students are encouraged to redesign an existing conventional part of a machine or product for 3D printing. The winners will be announced at the Additive World Conference on March 15th, 2017 in Eindhoven.\nPartners in the Design for Additive Manufacturing Challenge are leading CAE technology provider (e.g. Topology Optimization) - Altair Engineering, a consumer 3D printer manufacturer - Ultimaker, Autodesk - a leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment software and European Association of the Machine Tool Industries CECIMO. The contestants will be supported by the Additive Industries team in topology optimisation during the design process and the winners in both categories take home an Ultimaker 3D printer. Also the award winning designs will be printed in metal. On www.additiveworld.com more information on the Design Challenge can be found such as support by the Additive Industries team, evaluation criteria and how to submit your redesign.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://additivemanufacturingtoday.com/additive-industries-presents-3rd-edition-of-additive-manufacturing-design-challenge","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Additive

over a name for the process of making objects in an additive manner continues, \"additive manufacturing\" is losing momentum and \"3D printing\" is rising to the top. In a previous post, I stated that the winning name will be (or has been) selected by the media and the masses: Easy to say and unambiguous with a hint of something new and innovative.\nHowever, while writing a recent article, I realized that there is a much simpler rationale for \"3D printing.\" Simply change the suffix and presto - you have output (noun), process (verb) and device (noun). The same is not true for \"additive manufacturing.\"\nLet me prove it.\nYou can make a 3D print with a 3D printer that uses 3D printing. Now, try that with additive manufacturing: You can make an additive manufactured part with and additive manufacturing machine that use an additive manufacturing process.\nAs a writer and speaker, it is so much easier and so much more concise to use 3D print, printer and printing. I\u0027m confident that others feel the same way and that human nature (do what\u0027s easiest) will take over.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/4717/3D-Printing-The-Best-Moniker.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D

Class":"0","top_articles":"4","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Materialise was founded in 1990 by Fried Vancraen and offers 3D printing software and services. The company combines a large group of software developers with one of the largest Additive Manufacturing facilities in the world, equipped with more than 160 printers. They are continuously innovating the technologies behind 3D printing, which translates into more than 200 granted patents and 180 pending patent applications.\n\"Our mission is to innovate product development that results in a better and healthier world, through our software and hardware infrastructure, and an in- depth knowledge of Additive Manufacturing,\" explains Fried Vancraen, CEO of Materialise.\nMaterialise\u0027s software suite, better known as the Magics 3D Print Suite, includes industry- leading data preparation and design optimization tools, programs to integrate 3D printing into production environments, and software and control systems used by machine manufacturers to better bridge the gap between applications and 3D printers, allowing companies to meet the highest standards of the most demanding industries.\nHow are manufacturers changing to adjust to new 3D Printing and additive manufacturing technologies?\nBesides the freedom of design, 3D Printing has two crucial advantages for manufacturers: short lead times, and cost- effective mass customization. These advantages allow manufacturers to realize entirely new business models backed by digital supply chains and on- demand manufacturing.\nThe eyewear industry is one example that has made great use of these two benefits, but to take another example, the footwear industry is not far behind. Our collaboration with RS Scan for customized Phits insoles has already shown how individually tailored orthotics are well within reach today, and we worked with Adidas two years ago for the highly publicized Futurecraft project with 3D- printed midsoles. We also have an ongoing project with Tailored Fits, a Swiss startup that makes ski boots, for customized insoles that dramatically improve comfort and performance.\nAs for industrial goods manufacturers, production tools are a less often talked- about aspect of 3D Printing which can offer huge cost savings and efficiency gains. Our customer Philips Lighting realized a cost savings of EUR89,000 a year with reinvented production tools, while a food processing OEM uses 3D Printing for mass customized nozzles.\nHow does a manufacturer determine if the products they make will benefit from the use of 3D Printing?\nAt the product- level, we refer to certain \u0027drivers\u0027 for 3D Printing, a few characteristics that make a product or a part better suited for 3D Printing than conventional manufacturing technologies. One major example is complexity: when you want to design a part with internal channels, or with integrated hinges, conventional technologies won\u0027t be very helpful. This freedom of design can be used for functionality - as in the previous example - and also for aesthetics, as the eyewear industry has already shown. Three other key \u0027drivers\u0027 are lead time, cost reduction, and short series.\nOur most successful projects benefit from more than one of these factors. For instance, we work with aerospace company 328 Support Services GmbH to manufacture end- use plastic parts for the Do328 fleet of planes. These are after- market spare parts, so the volumes are low. Conventional manufacturing would force 328 to invest in tooling as well as storage space for the production tools and the parts themselves. With Additive Manufacturing, 328 doesn\u0027t have to run the risk of obsolete parts or storage costs.\nGenerally speaking, 3D Printing is ideal for any manufacturing project with high value and low volumes. One example of that is any project involving customization. Since 3D Printing doesn\u0027t need prior tooling, and encourages profitable short series, design upgrades can be put into production immediately, giving a brand a better chance to respond to market demands and trends.\nLet\u0027s say I am a small manufacturer, what are my main concerns when implementing 3D Printing?\nAM requires a change in conventional design principles, in order to reap the full benefits of 3D Printing. Mistakes arise when new users attempt to apply conventional design principles to AM, rather than designing with AM in mind. As with introducing any new process into an existing production line, that initial investment required to develop a new design and engineering approach for additive manufacturing can be a barrier. As AM continues to grow more affordable per cubic centimeter and more printable materials enter the market, particularly for Metal 3D Printing, that barrier will continue to disappear.\nWhere do you see the role of 3D Printing in Manufacturing now and 5 years from now.\nAdditive Manufacturing is a fast- paced world, and innovation is constant. The industrialization of 3D Printing is well under way, with increasingly widespread adoption of 3D Printing for serial production even in some of the toughest manufacturing environments. That dictates some of these trends, notably the demand for shorter lead times and more versatility in materials.\nAs 3D Printing enters serial production in industries like automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods, 3D Printing is faced with the challenge to meet the benchmarks of those industries. That means the new trends in Additive Manufacturing are geared towards ensuring and improving speed, reliability, repeatability and transparency in production. All of those parameters are visible and crucial to consumer goods like eyewear, where design iterations are fast, they\u0027re constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with 3D Printing, and they have to be produced with exacting precision and consistency. Extraordinary technology also needs extraordinary software. Without decent software, you can\u0027t prepare your designs for 3D printing and may experience multiple expensive build crashes. That\u0027s why we developed a versatile software platform that can support the needs of manufacturers in every step of the 3D printing process.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtomorrow.com/article/2018/05/talking-3d-printing-in-manufacturing-with-materialise/11659/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Talking

Additive manufacturing fits accurately with this historical trend, and many leaders in the business are going all- in on 3D printing or additive manufacturing.\nFREMONT, CA: With Industry 4.0 swaying, additive manufacturing is becoming ever more popular and disruptive in numerous industries, and aerospace is no exclusion. Compared to sectors, aerospace is one area that centers its focus on low- volume production of systems, which incorporates multifaceted electronic and mechanical components.\nThe aerospace industry has an extensive history of being an early adopter of new technology. Additive manufacturing fits accurately with this historical trend, and many leaders in the business are going all- in on 3D printing or additive manufacturing. 3D printing originally had a niche part in aerospace manufacturing as a technology for swift prototyping.\nHowever, with new developments, it is becoming a strategic technology, which is expected to produce value throughout the supply chain. If one has not incorporated the applications, then now is the time to harmonize or replace the existing prototyping and manufacturing processes with additive manufacturing.\nReduced Component Counts and Increased Product Complication\nThe aerospace industry has already thrived in additively manufacturing mechanical segments with intricate geometries, and fewer part counts, eventually reducing the weight of finished parts. The decline in the overall weight of an aircraft decreases fuel consumption. Electronic components formed with additive manufacturing comprise RF antennas and amplifiers, sensor arrays, multilayer cable assemblies, and other specialized pieces with a unique functionality and form factor.\nEase of Workability and Reduced Waste\nSome exotic metals form the foundation of most aerospace applications. These materials are difficult to work with in traditional processes. Yet, the materials are beginning to be integrated into additive manufacturing systems. The additive nature of 3D printing also considerably reduces waste compared to conventional subtractive processes. Even though materials used in additive processes are more costly, the concentrated material waste more than compensates for the material expenses. Going into the future, as more resource suppliers and a broader array of materials start becoming available in the market, overheads are expected to decline further while additive manufacturing tools increase.\nSee also: Top Aerospace Tech Solution

Class":"0","top_articles":"1","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Huntsman has outlined details of a new range of additive manufacturing materials that it has developed, which are set to address emerging needs in the 3D printing industry. Huntsman\u0027s IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform contains three different kinds of urethane- based materials (resins, powders and filaments).\nThese different kinds of materials can be 3D printed using a variety of additive manufacturing methods including stereolithography (SLA), high speed sintering (HSS) and fused filament fabrication (FFF).\nInitially, Huntsman is launching its range of soft, flexible IROPRINT additive manufacturing materials in the global footwear and sports industry, where 3D printing is being used to make both customised and mass manufactured shoes. Longer- term, Huntsman plans to roll its IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform out across a much wider range of applications and industries.\nAt present, the IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform includes three product lines, which have been optimised to work with the main 3D printing techniques preferred by footwear producers.\nIROPRINT R resins are a range of soft, durable, one- component liquid resin systems that can be 3D printed using SLA, digital light processing (DLP) and other radiation- curing methods.\nFor companies looking to 3D print with powder- based materials, IROPRINT P powders are a line of high performance thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) for HSS forms of printing.\nIROPRINT F filaments are a collection of high performance TPU materials, which have a consistent diameter, and are designed for use with fused filament fabrication (FFF) and other extrusion- based printing techniques.\nAll three IROPRINT additive manufacturing product lines have been optimised for the production of footwear components and are easy to use and print, offering advanced abrasion resistance, elongation and tear strength. For radiation- cured forms of printing such as SLA or DLP, IROPRINT R resins also offer a long pot life and quick cure capabilities.\nSpeaking at the K preview on Wednesday 3rd July, where Huntsman unveiled its IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform, Stephane Peysson, Global Business Development Manager at Huntsman Polyurethanes, said: \"Our innovation incubation team worked in close cooperation with end- users and industry leaders to develop our IROPRINT additive manufacturing product portfolio.\n\"Together, we looked closely at what makes a good 3D printing material, and what\u0027s been missing from the market to date. We believe the launch of our IROPRINT additive manufacturing portfolio fills a gap that exists for a range of functional, durable, yet softer 3D printing materials, which are technology agnostic, and both economical and easy to print - whatever your preferred production technique.\n\"Ahead of the launch of the range, we\u0027ve been building relationships with key technology partners, which in turn work with some of the biggest footwear brands in the world. Further down the line we see huge opportunities for our IROPRINT additive manufacturing materials in other sectors of the 3D printing market, from components for the automotive industry to objects for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n\"It is an incredibly exciting time to be in the additive manufacturing market, with estimates suggesting the sector is set to grow by more than 20% by 2024. We look forward to discussing the launch of our IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform with anyone actively involved in 3D printing at the main K show in October.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/3d-printing/new-dimension-in-3d-printing-with-additive-materials","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"New

This was the sentiment at the Inside 3D Printing NY show as attendees gathered in the Javits Center from April 10 to 12 to discuss the general state of additive manufacturing, its applications and what lies ahead. \"Investment [in 3D printing] hasn\u0027t been anything like it has been in the [past] 20 years in the industry. It\u0027s continually growing,\" said Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates, during his overview of the market.\nIndustries are still finding uses for the technology and investigating its benefits. If you look, you\u0027ll find examples of serious production using 3D printing that started with the medical and dental industries, but is growing into the aerospace, consumer product and automotive sectors, according to Wohlers. He said Airbus is one example of additive manufacturing adoption, and the company is on course to be producing over 30 tons of metal AM per month by December 2018.\nOverall, Wohlers noted, additive manufacturing is expected grow to be a $25.6 billion market by 2021. \"[Currently], growth is strong in desktop systems and metals. There\u0027s lots of startups, investments and development,\" he said.\nAppification of 3D Printing?\n3D printing companies are still finding new ways to encourage adoption. For consumers, this means providing software and hardware that is easy to use and requires minimal setup. Vendors are also finding ways to get developers and engineers on board - through apps. During his presentation, MakerBot CEO Jonathan Jaglom announced the MakerBot Thingiverse Developer Program, which lets community users create their own applications for 3D printing services, customization and modification. The company has already announced apps for 3D Hubs and Make Printable.\nJaglom: Integration between @makerbot, @3DHubs and @MakePrintable will help users fix models and print designs from Thingiverse #I3DPConf\n- Desktop Engineering (@DEeditor) April 11, 2016\n\"We invite all developers to tap into the Thingiverse community and tap into their best practices for [a] print, customization or file fixing. Whatever they think that they can provide to Thingiverse and offer solutions to our customer base,\" Jaglom said. \"This is what the world of tomorrow is going to look like.\"\nMakerBot isn\u0027t alone in offering 3D printing apps for the web, but this may be one of the first where users can create their own app for their individual 3D printing needs. Beyond this program, users can find a host of design applications for their smartphone or tablet by searching online or seeing if their 3D printing system has one. The easy accessibility of these applications might get more people interested in the technology and further increase adoption. \"MakerBot is all about providing accessible tools for 3D printing,\" said Jaglom, and this application model might just be one way to start.\nA Manufacturing Shift\nIn addition to new product releases and announcements, attendees also debated one of the main questions surrounding 3D printing: Will the technology replace traditional manufacturing? Additive manufacturing may not become the mainstream for many more years to come, but that doesn\u0027t mean manufacturing is stagnant. 3D printing is finding its place within the manufacturing and product design industries.\nAddressing this need for 3D printing, Peter Weijmarshausen, CEO of Shapeways, discussed the development of digital manufacturing and how printing systems offer a way to alter the landscape of manufacturing. \"The next wave of new technology is machines that we can use make things, but they make it in a different way,\" he said. \"This is the difference between mass manufacturing, which is an analog technology, and machines that can basically make any type of product. We\u0027re now starting to understand that these machines have capabilities that might enable us to transform manufacturing to a digital technology.\"\nThe idea of digital manufacturing, according to Weijmarshausen, changes who can make designs, what is made and where it\u0027s made. With 3D printers, end users now have access to the products they want by printing them, and manufacturers don\u0027t have to take the cost risks of mass- producing something for which there is no market.\nHowever, experts are still investigating how to address the gap between prototyping and full- scale production with 3D printing. \"There is a mutual exclusivity between the benefits of 3D printing and manufacturing, which hinders adoption,\" said Joseph DeSimone, CEO of Carbon. His company is working to address this by launching the new M1 system, which uses the CLIP (Continuous Liquid Interface Production) method. The proprietary system may be ushering in a new wave of rapid 3D printing, as well as a new pricing scheme for 3D printing systems.\nThe M1 will be sold on a subscription basis. The annual subscription will cost $40,000 per year, and includes a service team that uses operational data collected by the connected 3D printer to deliver predictive service and machine updates.\n\"The M1 is the kind of tool you expect for an Internet of Things world and manufacturing. Everything is software tunable,\" DeSimone said. Partnerships are also key for adoption, and DeSimone said Carbon is working to establish machine aggregates with service bureaus to offer manufacturing options.\nWhile the investment is heavy in additive manufacturing, presenters and attendees still feel the technology has a ways to go before it becomes the main product development standard. \"I think we\u0027re in the early days. However, we\u0027ve learned that change has been moving faster, so it could be within the next 5 to 10 years the amount of products made with 3D printing [is closer to] the amount of products made with traditional manufacturing. But what is needed for that is a few things, including the right materials that people recognize and like, the right content, the right prices, turnaround time and quality,\" says Weijmarshausen.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/3d-printing-whats-next","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D Printing:

from independent global research on the current and future use of industrial 3D printing. The study reveals that when it comes to adapting company operations to support large- scale 3D printing, there is a sizable gap between business functions that are thriving and those facing stumbling blocks with this organizational change. According to 3D printing stakeholders, design (62%) and engineering (61%) groups are experiencing the most success in adopting 3D printing at scale, while procurement (29%), and finance (26%) are struggling to achieve success.\nAs additive manufacturing moves mainstream, it not only rewrites the economics of production, it heralds a new era in manufacturing that will impact design, time- to- market, design cycles, customization, supply chains and pricing. However, reaping the rewards will require transformation in business processes from finance to procurement, training, design and engineering and beyond.\nEven the most experienced teams such as procurement and finance need to acquire new skills to fully unlock the benefits of additive manufacturing. While design is the most critical area of 3D printing and typically more adaptable in its efforts to support large- scale 3D printing, they are also the functional area requiring the most change. More than half (55%) of companies report they need to increase designer expertise in order to scale production of 3D printed parts. Other key organizational changes include evolving procurement strategies and processes (45%), changing mindsets of production teams (38%), redesigning supply chains (37%), and developing trusted TCO and ROI models (36%). A handful of participants also reported in some \"other\" challenges like difficulty with time, familiarity, and the customer mindset.\nEssentium and its partners are focused on helping customers embrace this change by delivering an open ecosystem that ensures greater control of innovation, more choice in materials, and industrial- scale production at ground- breaking economics. The company is also partnering to provide all the planning, installation, training and support necessary to help customers accelerate the shift from prototyping to industrial- scale additive manufacturing.\nBlake Teipel, Ph.D., CEO and Co- founder of Essentium, said: \"The bottom line is that additive manufacturing has the potential to dramatically transform manufacturing and profoundly impact the future of manufacturing. In this new world, companies have an obvious choice: either keep pace or get left behind. We are working closely with teams across organizational functions to ensure they have the skills and processes to leverage 3D printing to their advantage now and into the future.\"\nSurvey Methodology:\n162 managers and executives from large manufacturing companies across the world completed the survey on their current experiences, challenges and trends with 3D printing for production manufacturing. Participants included a mix of roles and were from companies across industries including aerospace, automotive, consumer goods and contract manufacturing.\nAbout Essentium\nEssentium, Inc. provides industrial 3D printing solutions that are disrupting traditional manufacturing processes by bringing product strength and production speed together, at scale, with a no- compromise engineering material set. Essentium manufactures and delivers innovative industrial 3D printers and materials enabling the world\u0027s top manufacturers to bridge the gap between 3D printing and machining and embrace the future of additive manufacturing.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/essentium-research-shows-change-management-a-priority-for-additive-manufacturing-301027584.html","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Essentium Research Shows Change Management A Priority For Additive Manufacturing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"Art:_Siemens Signs Deal to Acquire Additive Manufacturing Developer Atlas 3D","x":-4432.197265625,"y":-4729.60595703125,"id":"1133","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"91","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Siemens moves to acquire Atlas 3D\u0027s Sunata software, a cutting- edge DMLS additive manufacturing solution, to its Additive Manufacturing Network.\nIndustry giant Siemens AG has recently signed a deal to acquire Atlas 3D, a small additive manufacturing company based in Plymouth, Indiana. The acquisition is due to close in November 2019, and marks a clear move from Siemens to extend their grasp on the industrial automation industry. As of writing, the details of the acquisition have not yet been disclosed.\nAdditive Manufacturing and Sunata\nAtlas 3D\u0027s additive manufacturing solution is called Sunata- a cloud- based additive manufacturing software utilizing DMLS, and currently compatible with Ti64, 316L stainless steel, AlSi10MG, Ferrium C64 steel, 17- 4PH stainless steel, and Inconel alloy 718, as well as other materials.\nThe program allows designers and engineers to create parts that are more often \"right first time,\" cutting down on design expenditures and the amount of iterations required for successful builds.\nChad Barden, Chief Executive Officer of Atlas 3D acknowledged that Siemens already has additive manufacturing solutions and that he expects Sunata to be a good fit.\n\"The power of Sunata is that it equips designers to more easily design parts that are printable, which helps companies more quickly realize the benefits of additive manufacturing,\" he said in a statement. He went on to explain that Sunata will be able to offer new levels of efficiency for front- end \"design- for- additive\" processes.\nBarden also, however, pointed out that the acquisition will allow Sunata to also aid those who have yet to introduce additive manufacturing into their existing systems.\nPart Design Capabilities\nSunata achieves this standard by giving initial part designers an industry- leading level of control over the part design process. The Sunata program automatically considers key factors such as support structure, part orientation, distortion, and heat extraction uniformity without the need to consult additional engineering specialists later in the production stream for testing and new part iterations.\nBy leveraging these capabilities alongside concurrent GPU/CPU rendering, Atlas 3D has cut down what was previously a 40% failure rate on initial prints in additive metal printing.\nSiemens: Sunata\u0027s New Home\nSiemens AG is one of the largest industrial automation players in the world, and their acquisition of Sunata only cements this position.\nZvi Feuer, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing Engineering Software of Siemens Digital Industries Software said, \"Our solutions industrialize additive manufacturing for large enterprises, 3D printing service bureaus, design firms, and CAD designers.\" Feuer explained that the appeal of Sunata is its ease of use in implementing more efficient processes in the industrial space: \"The combination of Sunata with the robust CAE additive manufacturing tools in Simcenter enables a \u0027right first- time\u0027 approach for industrial 3D printing.\"\nAdditive Manufacturing Network\nAdditionally, Siemens\u0027s acquisition of Sunata will likely see it included in their portfolio of additive manufacturing solutions, the Siemens Additive Manufacturing Network. Sunata\u0027s powerful capabilities will further strengthen the offerings of Siemens\u0027s AMN, giving designers new, powerful tools to utilize during the design process.\nFurthermore, this development marks another addition to the additive manufacturing portion of Xcelerator, Siemens\u0027s complete software portfolio.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://control.com/news/siemens-signs-deal-to-acquire-additive-manufacturing-developer-atlas-3d/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Siemens

Their collaboration is a further extension of DSM\u0027s ongoing commitment to build a 3D printing ecosystem, aimed at driving innovation in additive manufacturing and encouraging its adoption across industries. Together, the two companies will co- develop new 3D printed solutions for medical, automotive, and apparel applications. DSM and Twikit are currently working on an end- to- end production workflow for 3D printed orthotics and prosthetics, showcasing additive manufacturing\u0027s unparalleled customizability.\nInnovation with End- to- End 3D Printing Solutions\nCombining DSM\u0027s proven materials and market reach with Twikit\u0027s experience in software development and application development will facilitate extensive progress in advanced manufacturing techniques. The partnership between the two companies will lead to revolutionary new customizability and made- to- measure turnkey solutions across various industries. Both Twikit and DSM are known for their partnership approach across the 3D printing value chain.\nFocus on Automotive, Healthcare and Footwear\nSpecifically, DSM and Twikit will explore new applications in the automotive, healthcare, and footwear industries. The process leading up to the final 3D printed product will always comprise an initial 3D scan, product design, material optimization, testing and modeling. Twikit\u0027s unique morphing algorithm will further enable and improve the design of made- to- measure products.\nThe automotive industry gains from personalized dashboards, light covers and car seats. Aside from delivering customizability, additive manufacturing facilitates weight reduction and increased vehicle safety. Other important advantages of 3D printing include spare parts on demand, low volume production, and a more efficient production process.\nThe healthcare industry should also benefit greatly from a digital transformation, i.e. performance- enhanced medical solutions provided by precise, made- to- measure applications based on detailed scans of the human body. 3D printed medical solutions also have shorter lead times and lower production costs than traditionally manufactured equivalents.\nLast, but not least, 3D printed, and made- to- measure mid insoles will enable major advances in customizable footwear. Individualized soles and insoles are known for their increased performance and comfort, in addition to reducing the risk of injuries for end users.\nBringing 3D Printing to the Production Floor\nHugo da Silva, VP Additive Manufacturing DSM, says: \"Our partnership with Twikit allows us to make significant advances in key sectors that stand to benefit from the wider- scale adoption of additive manufacturing. In healthcare, for example, 3D printed, made- to- measure prosthetics and orthotics will positively impact people\u0027s lives across the globe. Reinforcing our 3D printing ecosystem with experienced partners like Twikit enables us to offer customers not just materials, but also expertise and insights to translate market needs into total 3D printed solutions. By providing end- to- end solutions, we are able to accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing at scale.\"\nOne specific market Twikit and DSM are focusing on is the prosthetics and orthotics industry. Despite the clear advantages of advanced additive manufacturing techniques in terms of customizability and production efficiency, their adoption by prosthetics and orthotics manufacturers is still limited.\nBy integrating DSM\u0027s proven and certified materials with Twikit\u0027s software, the resulting 3D printing turnkey solution provides patients with better and faster care. Patients stand to benefit from a higher level of comfort and faster healing thanks to made- to- measure 3D printed medical solutions. The companies are also working together with printer OEMs, to give prosthetics and orthotics manufacturers a turnkey full solution and full access to the 3D printing value chain.\nThe aim is to market Twikit\u0027s made- to- measure software solution \u0027TwikFit\u0027 and develop tested and verified product templates. The jointly developed and integrated applications by DSM and Twikit will be unveiled to the public at Formnext 2019 in Frankfurt.\nMartijn Joris, CEO \u0026 co- founder of Twikit, adds: \"Prosthetics and orthotics are an excellent example of the digital transformation and the enhanced customizability enabled by 3D printing. Our work in other sectors, such as the apparel and automotive industries, has already demonstrated that additive manufacturing can generate high value for OEMs through individualization. With the partnership, we will accelerate growth and innovation across the 3D printing value chain.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID\u003d52441","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"DSM and Twikit to Co-develop New 3D Printed Solutions for Medical and Automotive","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"innovation accelerator","x":-2535.14794921875,"y":1181.20166015625,"id":"45","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"1","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"1","num_appearance":"3","initial_node_score":"0.9533824864774942","real_tf_idf":"0.571","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":15.0},{"label":"material technology","x":1211.0213623046875,"y":-2724.107666015625,"id":"614","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"17","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"66","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"5","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"14","initial_node_score":"0.3524888912215829","real_tf_idf":"1.748","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(122,114,30)","size":20.0},{"label":"Art:_Metal X Systems and their Growing Benefits","x":-4214.39208984375,"y":1085.7816162109375,"id":"1101","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"58","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Advancement in additive manufacturing has transformed the way of products design, development, manufacture, and distribution. Additive manufacturing is also known as 3D printing, and it has paved the way for newer designs, lighter and safer products. The cost of manufacturing the products is reduced through this technology.\nMarkforged is an additive manufacturing company located in Watertown, MA, that produces complicated parts for the factories, which is transforming the manufacturing industry. Most of the engineers and designers prefer the Markforged metal and composite printers for tooling and in other manufacturing purposes.\nGreg Mark, CEO, and founder of Markforged says, \"Demand for affordable, strong, and safe metal 3D printing has never been greater.\"\nOn November 6, 2018, Markforged shipped over 100 units of its metal 3D printing system the Metal X to clients around the world. Metal X is a 3D printer to work with a technology called Atomic Diffusion Additive Manufacturing (ADAM). The ADAM process uses the metal powders that are embedded in plastic which eliminates the toxicity and flammability which is natural in these powders. The final part is obtained by carrying out the sintering process after the material is printed layer by layer with the powders. By sintering the entire piece at once, the layers become more solid, which is not possible in other 3D printing processes.\nAccording to the company, the 3D printer enables users to speed up turnaround times for product development and production, create components on demand, simplify logistics, and easily adjust production. The Metal X system is available at a low cost and is easy to install. With this system, the acceleration time for the new products innovation takes very less time.\nMarkforged metal printers serve hundreds of customers, from global manufacturers to local small business. With 3D printing, the new and innovative products reach the market quicker and with fewer investments. The future of additive manufacturing looks bright. 3D printing will be more prominent in the production landscape in the future. As costs decrease and processes become more efficient, the use of additive manufacturing will be considerably increased.\nSee Also: The Manufacturing Outlook","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtechnologyinsights.com/news/metal-x-systems-and-their-growing-benefits-nwid-590.html","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Metal X Systems and their Growing Benefits","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"manufacturing industry","x":-2558.554931640625,"y":-2954.0283203125,"id":"171","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"1","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"11","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"4","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"4","num_appearance":"196","initial_node_score":"8.899683500407264","real_tf_idf":"12.948","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(255,52,13)","size":30.0},{"label":"Art:_Additive Manufacturing Both Ubiquitous \u0026 Nascent","x":-4453.4169921875,"y":-2126.38037109375,"id":"1059","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"16","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Four out of five manufacturers say that they are using 3D printing today. At the same time, prototyping claims the lion\u0027s share of the activity. We are at a tipping point where, over the next few years, 3D printing will likely change manufacturing and its supply chain dramatically.\n\"The reality is that he cost of printing has come down so much in the past few years that it is easy for anybody to be at least be dabbling in 3D printing,\" John Dulchinos, vice president, Digital Manufacturing at contract manufacturer Jabil told EBN. \"A lot of it ends up being just that. However, anyone doing design work who isn\u0027t using 3D printing is behind the curve.\"\nIn short, the promise and complexities associated with 3D printing in manufacturing abound. \"As one of the fundamental building blocks around 3D printing, additive manufacturing over time will have a profound impact on supply chain,\" Dulchinos. \"We were all starting at ground zero, though. There isn\u0027t a lot of well- defined literature or history on using additive manufacturing for functional production parts.\"\nIndustrial 3D printers and new printing materials are bringing the price of printing parts into closer parity with injection molding. However, organizations need to work toward seamlessly integrating the technology into their existing processes in a way that works. Jabil, working with Dimensional Research, sponsored a research report that bears these findings out. The 3D Printing Trends Report polled 303 people in manufacturing who are responsible for decisions around 3D printing.\nTo bring 3d printing from prototyping to production parts, though, well- thought out processes and tools are critical. For example, manufacturers continue to struggle with questions of measuring quality, Dulchinos explained. For example, how can a part be \"known good\" when it could have been printing on any printer and any part of the printer bed? What methodology, discipline, or process would solve that quandary? How do you make it repeatable?\nFurther, the advent of production- level 3D printing will change the face of the supply chain process in a variety of ways. For example, for molded parts, organizations might make quarterly or even annual forecasts in order to capture efficiencies of scale. With a 3D printer, a variety of parts for one end product might be produced on a single printer bed. \"Instead of doing it batched by part numbers, we would do it for families, and do it just in time,\" said Dulchinos. \"In traditional manufacturing, there are setup charges so the last ones are cheap compared to the first ones. In 3D printing, it\u0027s all digital files and so the setup charges are lower. You are thinking about the aggregate business rather than a volume module.\nOther changes may occur as well. The nature of 3D printing also may allow for parts that must be injection molded separately and then assembled be printed on a 3D printer as a single part. The ability to create products on demand may also push the trend of near- sourcing as well. \"Now, we are at a point where we can move production back and forth from different factories by shipping files,\" Dulchinos said. \"True digital production operations allow for the rebalancing of manufacturing and that changes the way you think about supply chain.\"\nFurther, additive manufacturing has the potential to support customization of products, a key factor for many consumers. \"Today, the current state of the art is single color but directionally the technology is going ultimately allows us to change part characteristics on the fly,\" Dulchinos explained\nIn short, additive manufacturing is bound to gain traction because the benefits will outweigh the costs overall for many manufacturers. Dulchinos said:\n3D printing is really simple: You have to be selective about applciations but it is clear that we are watching the beginning of a revolution. It delivers two value propositions. First, it enables frictionless manufacturing, in that you don\u0027t have to invest in a tool to product things, and that opens the door for things you couldn\u0027t do before. The other is the ability to have freedom of design.\nThe infographic below outlines some of the findings of the report.

can reduce costs, shorten throughput times and enable previously unimaginable component geometries. Read the interview with Martin Folie, Sales Manager Additive Manufacturing and 3D printer at alphacam swiss GmbH about the current trends in 3D printing.\nSMM: What current trends do you see in additive manufacturing?\nMartin Folie: The topic of rapid prototyping continues to take center stage. Companies that have so far had little to do with 3D printing have now realized that 3D printing is a serious technology and not just a brief hype. This is why 3D printers are still an attractive option when it comes to quickly producing components that serve as demonstration objects, for functional checks and for comparing different variants - or if you are simply asked to present a sample component.\nThe second trend is production, using 3D printing, i.e. additive manufacturing - AM. The market is ready for companies already involved in 3D printing to discover applications in which they can gain a greater advantage from 3D- printed components. These can include the reduction of costs, shorter production times or the production of complete assemblies in a single process using 3D printing. But users are increasingly recognizing the advantage of producing components without geometric boundaries. This means you can design components that cannot be manufactured using conventional manufacturing processes. Only 3D printing makes this possible.\nIn my point of view, it is important to focus on the development of new components. 3D printing must be taken into account as a possible manufacturing process during the brainstorming phase of the development processes. This unlocks the great potential of designing for 3D printing - the huge freedom of design. However, this requires a rethinking of the developers and designers. This new approach requires a learning process on part of the manufacturing companies. It affects all departments, such as development, construction, production, marketing, assembly and design. You need to understand the peculiarities of 3D printing. Only when the employees grasp its possibilities can 3D printing and thus additive manufacturing unleash its full potential.\nHow will 3D printing develop in the near future?\nM. Folie: In the future, 3D printing with plastic will become faster and more materials can be processed. The devices will become better, but also more expensive. Industrial equipment in particular will deliver much faster results. Stratasys demonstrated this with the Stratasys Infinite- Build 3D Demonstrator and Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator 3D printers two years ago at the IMTS trade show in Chicago. The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator was developed together with Siemens in just two months. It works with eight axes. A robot gripper arm guides an FDM nozzle and prints components made of polyamide PA12, which contains 35 % carbon fibers, onto a swivel table. Since the printer does not need any supporting material and the plastic flows very quickly in the nozzle, the 3D printing of a 250 mm high component with 135 mm diameter only takes about 43 minutes. This is otherwise not possible with today\u0027s FDM technology.\nThe Stratasys Infinite- Build 3D Demonstrator prints horizontally and thus continuously. The printer is open on the back side. In this way, it can produce components with a length of several meters. The maximum speed at the nozzle is 0.245 m/s. This is achieved by a new technology of the FDM printer head. It uses granulate and an extruder, similar to injection molding. Thanks to this technology, the 3D printer accelerates the process by up to 0.508 m/s. Theoretically, this new head can achieve speeds of 2.54 m/s. Compared with current technologies, this is very fast. This is of course particularly attractive for the production of large components.\nOther processes, such as laser sintering, stereolithography and multijet fusion, will also be become more important in the future, because they offer higher speeds and greater material diversity.\nHow is the quality of 3D- printed components ensured - especially for applications in medicine, automotive and aviation?\nM. Folie: There are some materials on the market that have already been certified for the specific applications. These include biocompatible materials for medical applications, which can also come into contact with mucous membranes. Implantable materials are also available. However, no long- term studies have been conducted yet.\nCertified plastics and metals for 3D printing are available for the aerospace industry. Stratasys has a certified machine for this purpose. It can manufacture components for the aerospace industry as well as for rail vehicles and automotive applications. The main advantages of these special components are their light weight and extensive freedom of design. A new, very exciting application is the fast delivery of spare parts. This is especially favorable for aviation.\nIn your opinion, which peripherals and software software solutions need to be realized in the next one to two years, in order for 3D printing to meet the requirements of industrial users?\nM. Folie: CAD manufacturers are already offering modules that can send component data directly from the CAD program to the 3D printer. Current software can calculate topological optimizations of the geometry of components and even edit them to establish links to other components. In addition, software manufacturers will in future take the printing process into consideration and influence its course. For example, it will be possible to prevent the material in thin walls and edges from scorching.\nStratasys has developed GrabCAD Print - an innovative software especially for industrial 3D printing. It is currently only compatible with products of this manufacturer. As it is continuously being updated, it will also be usable in conjunction with 3D printers from other manufacturers in the future.\nHow do you assess the chances of \u0027real\u0027 series production with additive manufacturing, i.e. quantities of several thousand or ten thousand components per year? Will producers be able to do that in the foreseeable future by using automation?\nM. Folie: That\u0027s a good but difficult to answer question. I think that with the current 3D printing technologies there is still a lot of potential for improvement with regard to speed. But we a few tens of thousands of components per year will soon push the limits of this technology.\nAs an example, I would like to mention the manufacturer Desktop Metal. The company intends to launch a metal 3D production machine at the end of 2019. It is supposed to be able to produce 500 water pump wheels within 24 hours for the engine cooling circuit of passenger cars. These are the pure printing times without including the subsequent sintering process. With 500 components per day on one machine, 180,000 pieces can be produced per year. This can already be described as series production. If several of these 3D printers work in a production hall, we have arrived at a \u0027real\u0027 large series production. But we should be open to surprises. Much will still become possible in the coming years.\nWhat should interested parties and users do and consider in advance to ensure that they can use 3D printing efficiently and economically?\nM. Folie: As mentioned earlier, working with 3D printing is the most important way to get the most out of 3D printing. To stay informed about the latest news is also part of it. In my opinion, a company should have at least one employee who is constantly occupied with news, developments and trends in the world of technology. Depending on the size of the company, this person may be employed on a monthly basis for a few days or full- time in the case of larger companies. For many companies it is particularly challenging to keep pace with today\u0027s development rate on the global market. The flow of information grows exponentially every year. In a few years we will only meet specialists, because an individual can no longer absorb and process the information.\nWhich basic and advanced training courses can you recommend?\nM. Folie: For 3D printing, some institutions and manufacturers of 3D printers are already offering worthwhile courses and advanced training. For example, the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Winterthur has been offering courses and academic study content on 3D printing for several years now. The manufacturer Stratasys also offers workshops. Stratasys Academy experts share extensive expertise, from proper 3D printing design to operating and servicing specific 3D printers. Only Alphacam specialists are certified as trainers for the entire German- speaking region.\nThe interview was conducted by Konrad Mucke SMM.\nThis article was first published by Schweizer MaschinenMarkt.\nOriginal: Konrad Mucke / Translation: Alexander Stark\n(ID:45835207)","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.spotlightmetal.com/3d-printing-opens-up-new-dimensions-a-817604/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D Printing Opens Up New Dimensions","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"colorado","x":140.55308532714844,"y":-916.3009033203125,"id":"502","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"11","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"51","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"11","initial_node_score":"1.090791909955442","real_tf_idf":"1.64","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(60,134,15)","size":20.0},{"label":"audi","x":-2215.52685546875,"y":-185.63980102539062,"id":"958","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"330","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"15","initial_node_score":"4.352519067004323","real_tf_idf":"3.441","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_Inside 3D Printing Düsseldorf 2016","x":1290.809326171875,"y":-343.991455078125,"id":"1119","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"76","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Inside 3D Printing will be taking place next on February 24 and 25 at the Dusseldorf trade fair grounds together with the METAV, the international trade fair for technologies in metal processing. Inside 3D Printing offers a conference on additive manufacturing covering metals and plastic components. The focus industries of the next conference are aerospace, automobile, tool manufacturing, and medical technology. Through a cooperation with METAV, Inside 3D Printing will deliver educational synergies for the participants while greatly increase the number of visitors to the accompanying exhibition.\nOther planned highlights of the event are wearables, i.e. wearable devices connected to the Internet and a range of topics on Industry 4.0 and the \"Internet of Things\". Dr. Eric Klemp, Commercial Director of the Direct Manufacturing Research Center (DMRC) of the Universitat Paderborn and program coordinator of the conference says: \"The factory of the future will be much more networked than today and additive manufacturing will be an increasingly important method of manufacture. It will facilitate the integration of an unimaginable intelligence even into the smallest of components. Thanks to 3D printing, even \u0027smart\u0027 products -  from fashionable accessories, to technical tools and aids for the workplace or nursing care -  can be created with a degree of individualisation and personalisation never before possible. We are presenting fascinating, technical presentations and application examples.\"\nInside 3D Printing was created by Mecklermedia and Rising Media to serve as a forum for professional exchange on a range of topics about additive manufacturing and drew over 3,000 visitors at its premier in 2013 in New York. Since then, the event has been held in nine different cities including New York, Tokyo, Singapore, Santa Clara, Mumbai, and Shanghai. Being presented will be new business opportunities though 3D printing, case examples from companies and the current state of research on the technology. The event producers agreed to a cooperation between Inside 3D Printing and METAV for the German conference last November. All METAV visitors will have access to Inside 3D Printing and the new \"Additive Manufacturing Area\", an exhibition area, including forum on additive manufacturing processes, which is also being organised by Rising Media.\nInside 3D Printing is aimed at experts, researchers, service providers, manufacturers, merchants, and investors, as well as experts from various industries who want to expand their knowledge about the professional use of 3D printing technologies. The roughly 60 conference sessions will present business opportunities, case examples, and the current state of research on the technology. The companies sharing their experiences at the last event in March included Airbus, Boeing, Cassidian, EDAG, EOS, Fraunhofer- Gesellschaft, Hermle, HP, Materialise, Phoenix Contact and SLM. Over 1,000 participants flocked to the expert presentations each day and exchanged ideas and experiences at the accompanying exhibition with forty exhibitors, sponsors, and conference partners.\nThrough the integration into the METAV, exhibitors and sponsors of Inside 3D Printing can expect an even greater number of professional visitors and additional attention in the metal- processing industry.

Quocirca\u0027s Louella Fernandes explains.\nWhile AI and robotics will principally serve to make industrial processes more efficient, 3D printing has the potential to fundamentally restructure industrial processes from the bottom up and underpin the transition from traditional to digital manufacturing.\nUsing 3D printing (referred to as additive manufacturing (AM)) is already generating new opportunities through the lowering of material and overhead costs, shortening the time to market through rapid prototyping, and increasingly for the production of final parts. The ability to make low to mid- volume runs of complex parts quickly and cost- effectively is an attractive proposition.\nHowever, the role of 3D printing as a catalyst for Industry 4.0 is not without its challenges, including uncertainty around regulation, worker expertise, regulatory uncertainty and long- term costs for mass manufacturing.\nAfter a chequered early life, technological breakthroughs have enabled the adoption of 3D printing to move beyond just prototyping and into industrial applications, including final assembles. Furthermore, the arrival of GE, as well as a growing number of traditional print OEMs including Ricoh, HP and Xerox, has increased competitive pressure. A collaborative ecosystem is evolving, such as HP\u0027s strategic partnership with BASF for materials, SIEMENS for software solutions, and GKN for metal binder jetting development.\n3D printing business benefits\nAdditive manufacturing can eliminate the need for expensive, labour intensive tooling for final parts, reduce overall lead time, streamline supply chains and support a more agile response to the market. Companies can also cut the costs of producing bespoke products, thanks to a reduction of tooling and waste (the latter by as much at 80%, thus bringing an environmental advantage too). 3D printing also allows new business models through disruption of traditional manufacturing and slashes warehousing and inventory costs. Decentralised production of spare parts of any batch size is a big gain for some businesses, for instance maritime and logistics.\nBridging the gap between traditional manufacturing and additive technologies, 3D printing of injection moulds may not have the durability of their steel counterparts, but they can be effective for low volume, limited productions runs, such as for bridge tools or prototyping. The ability to carry out prototyping in- house also has a sizeable impact in cutting R\u0026D, tooling and capital costs, as well as reducing the time to market and faster feedback loops (\u0027fail fast rather than fail slow\u0027).\nFinally, 3D printing supports product innovation. It overcomes many of the design restrictions, such as the production of parts with geometries and complexities previously impossible to achieve. 3D printing also fits in well with the design megatrend of lightweighting - 3D printed metals can increase performance and resilience of parts that are both light and durable.\nFrom prototyping to production\nThe barriers previously limiting final production in 3D printing have been lowered for two primary reasons. First, refinements in selective laser sintering (SLS), solid deposition modelling (SDM), and other additive technologies have increased manufacturing control, accuracy and predictability. Second, increases in the quality and properties of existing polymers and metals, and new possibilities in ceramics, nylon, carbon fibre, precious metals and other materials, have altered the landscape of opportunity in all kinds of markets.\nFor instance, a growing number of components for ventilation, heating, cable clamps and air conditioning ducts for jet engines and aircraft cabin interiors are being produced using polymeric printing. Other examples include shop- floor drilling guides and assembly jigs. Major aerospace firms have already added metal 3D components to their assembly lines. GE Additive produces additively manufactured fuel nozzles for LEAP, the popular commercial aviation engine. Compared to their predecessors, these 3D printed fuel nozzles reduce the risk of human error and weight by 25%.\nIn medical devices, 3D printing is enabling true personalisation of patient- specific surgical cutting guides, implants and prosthetics. It is also being used to make 3D facsimiles of CT and MRI scan data, which surgeons can use to plan complex procedures, reducing theatre time, plus associated cost and risk. Pioneers include Poland- based Glaze, a specialist manufacturer of prosthetic arms.\nGlaze has global distributors connected to prosthetic clinics, who scan and provide amputee data, including exact dimensions, parameters and colour preferences. This information is then input into Glaze\u0027s software system and printed to each individual\u0027s exact specification. This shortens lead times, reduces costs and most important of all, provides patients with fully customised prosthetics that are up to ten times lighter than conventional products.\nFactories of the future\nThe factories of the future are not, however, going to be merely filled with 3D printers of the type that already exist. They will be hybrid engines of Industry 4.0 that utilise every technology material and software advantage available. As the centrepiece of these digital factories, units based on 3D printed technology are being designed as fully interactive nodes in a network capable of self- healing, predictive maintenance, and responding to every facet of a digital factory environment.\nFor example, Siemens IIoT- enabled software for HP\u0027s 5200 series allows for full print plant simulation, using real- time process data to model and optimise equipment, material flow, and personnel. This \u0027digital twin\u0027 of the whole process, from individual printer to entire factory, allows for targeted automation to decrease bottlenecks. In turn, this increases productivity and sustainability. The fusion of data intelligence, software, services, and materials innovation, will drive the advance towards manufacturing predictability, with high quality and optimal yield of parts at industrial levels of efficiency, accuracy and repeatability.\nWhat needs to happen next?\nThe foundation for 3D printing\u0027s future seems sound - the technologies are proving their value in the real- world, plus the growing ecosystem of innovators and contributors, including printer OEMS like HP, are fuelling its growth. There are, however, still some barriers that need to be overcome, notably a talent shortage. Currently, the pace of growth of the 3D printing industry is outstripping the supply of knowledgeable talent, and many organisations are expressing concerns over their ability to successfully implement 3D strategies, with much of their in- house expertise being geared to traditional manufacturing.\n3D printing firms, OEMs, government and the entire ecosystem need to play an active role in contributing to the knowledge based. Also, the far- reaching impact of AM on the entire manufacturing process will require a more complete distribution of skills across the work cycle, from advanced CAD modelling through to process engineering, machine specific skills and machine management. Even when these issues are addressed, the future of 3D printing requires a change in thinking, working with the right people and the right approach.\nRegulations are not yet a roadblock, but could potentially become one in the future, if history is any guideline, but of more imminent concern are materials costs and build speed. Metal powders, for example, are still expensive, and while 3D printing can reduce time to market, production speeds are currently too slow for some applications. These barriers are not insurmountable, however, and material science R\u0026D, and continued collaboration in the industry will maintain pressure on material costs, particularly for polymeric printing. As 3D printing equipment evolves, for example, increased printer bed sizes, crucial time will be shaved off average build time.\nThough it is hard to make precise predictions at this early stage, all indications are that the future of 3D printing lies in mass manufacturing. Certainly, it looks increasingly likely that additive manufacturing will be a key element of smart factories of the future.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/production/3d-printing-a-catalyst-for-industry-4-0","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D

manufacturing with the Additive Manufacturing Pavilion. The show will run from September 12- 17 at McCormick Place in Chicago.\n\"Additive manufacturing is a reality for the industrial marketplace. It\u0027s not fully mature, but the technology has progressed far enough that if you\u0027re ignoring 3D printing at IMTS 2016, you\u0027re making a big mistake,\" says David Burns, founder and principal of Global Business Advisory Services LLC. \"Fortunately, within the IMTS Additive Manufacturing Pavilion, you\u0027ll find companies that offer a full suite of 3D products, and they\u0027re good at explaining the benefits.\"\nBurns adds that technology advancements occur so rapidly that staying on top of new developments requires constant work. As it applies to 3D printing, developments include new metallurgies, new machines and a suite of design tools.\nAccording to IMTS, exhibitors include ExOne, EOS of North America, 3D Systems, Statasys, HP, Optomec, Proto Labs, EnvisionTEC, Cideas, DM3D Technology, SCIAKY, 3rd Dimension Industrial 3D Printing, Hybrid Manufacturing Technologies, GPI Prototype \u0026 Manufacturing Services, Linear AMS - and more still being added.\n\"The Additive Manufacturing Pavilion showcases essentially every component necessary for a manufacturing cell,\" he says. \"In addition, the technology has progressed so far that you\u0027ll also see it on the show floor. Several of the leading machine tool providers will demonstrate \u0027hybrid machines\u0027 that integrate 3D printing and traditional machine tool capabilities.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/imts-2016-additive-manufacturing-pavilion-showcases-technologies","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"IMTS 2016 Additive Manufacturing Pavilion Showcases Technologies","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"ul","x":1267.174072265625,"y":-4593.88720703125,"id":"1036","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"1","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"978","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"16","initial_node_score":"3.822739009745419","real_tf_idf":"4.209","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(255,52,13)","size":25.0},{"label":"laser sintering","x":2882.204833984375,"y":-395.08978271484375,"id":"853","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"14","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"142","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"4","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"107","initial_node_score":"3.409018608974293","real_tf_idf":"8.069","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(192,79,112)","size":30.0},{"label":"mono r supercar","x":-2666.612060546875,"y":-2362.83203125,"id":"382","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"8","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"34","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"1","top_kp":"3","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"1","num_appearance":"2","initial_node_score":"0.49441033601760864","real_tf_idf":"0.161","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(162,128,0)","size":15.0},{"label":"additive manufacturing design","x":-590.601806640625,"y":-6001.560546875,"id":"533","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"1","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"55","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"1","top_kp":"4","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"1","num_appearance":"7","initial_node_score":"0.4383320137858391","real_tf_idf":"0.853","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(255,52,13)","size":15.0},{"label":"Art:_3D Printing’s Next Frontier","x":-3252.667724609375,"y":4750.42333984375,"id":"1107","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"64","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"f you follow the 3D printing market in the mainstream media, it may look like it\u0027s cooling down. 3D Systems discontinued its consumer- focused Cube 3D printer. Solidoodle, once and up- and- coming manufacturer of consumer 3D printers, has ceased operations. And last year 3D printing went from making headlines for new startups to making headlines for stock market declines. But that\u0027s only part of the story.\nAccording to Wohlers Report 2016, the additive manufacturing (AM) industry, consisting of all additive manufacturing products and services worldwide, grew 25.9% (CAGR) to $5.165 billion in 2015. The CAGR for the previous three years was 33.8%. The firm reports that despite challenges, growth continued in many segments of the diverse industry, particularly in metal AM and the desktop 3D printer segments. In 2015, 62 manufacturers sold industrial- grade AM systems (those valued at more than $5,000), compared to 49 in 2014, and twice as many as the 31 companies that sold industrial systems in 2011.\nSo while consumer 3D printing hype may have plateaued for now, the 3D printing industry as a whole is still growing at an impressive rate thanks in part to industrial investments. At the Inside 3D Printing Conference last month in New York, Terry Wohlers said even most of the sub- $5,000 3D printers were sold to industrial users, not consumers. Given the amazing success the dental and medical sectors are seeing with their adoption of 3D printing, it\u0027s no wonder other industries are following in their footsteps. The path to industrial 3D printing is being paved by 3D printing materials and more advanced 3D printing software.\nMaterials Moving Forward\nNot long ago, materials were a significant question mark that gave many industrial users pause when considering 3D printing. Are the materials we need capable of being 3D printed? Are 3D printed materials strong/flexible/chemical- resistant/flame- retardant enough? Is there enough supply?\nThose questions have been answered to the affirmative for many industries. For example, Wohlers said Airbus is on track to print 30 tons of metal monthly by the end of 2018.\nAn impressive amount of research and development has gone into 3D printing materials- from composites to ceramics to 3D printing multiple materials at the same time- and it is already paying off.\nSoftware Playing Catch Up\n\"Software isn\u0027t keeping up with the technology,\" said Hod Lopson, professor of engineering at Columbia University and a co- author of the book \"Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing.\" Lopson was addressing journalists at a recent Stratasys launch event for the company\u0027s new J750 3D printer. \"These printers now can make so much more than the software allows us to access.\n\"The CAD companies, I think, need to do more to keep up with the technology,\" Lopson continued. \"There\u0027s a big, big gap, and in fact I think software is holding us up from exploring the true potential of the [3D printing] technology right now.\"\nWhere there\u0027s a technology gap, there\u0027s an opportunity. Will it be filled by traditional CAD software companies, 3D printer manufacturers, industry titans or startups? Perhaps it will be a combination.\nThrough its Spark Investment Fund, Autodesk has invested in Optomec, an additive manufacturing provider. The companies intend to corroboratively develop software tools using Autodesk\u0027s open source Spark 3D printing platform to better connect hardware and software for additive manufacturing, according to the press release. GE Ventures has also invested in Optomec to advance 3D printed sensors, electronics and metal applications.\n3D Systems and Stratasys- known primarily as leading 3D printer hardware makers- have both acquired design software companies. 3D Systems acquired Geomagic in 2013 and Stratasys acquired GrabCAD in 2014.\nBut 3D printers are capable of building complex parts with cores of intricate lattice structures that no human designer is going to manually push and pull their way to in any 3D CAD application. The cutting edge of 3D printing lies in software\u0027s ability to suggest optimized structures based on engineering requirements and materials.\nAdvances in materials and software are the next frontier of 3D printing. Rather than slowing down, the technology is getting real for more and more industries as the return on investment is proven, the materials are formulated and easy to use, powerful software is being developed.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/3d-printings-next-frontier","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D Printing’s Next

In order to grow the number of examples and inspire many other industries to develop dedicated applications for industrial 3D printing, Additive Industries is presenting the fourth edition of the Additive World Design for Additive Manufacturing Challenge.\nCompeting in two categories, both professionals and students are encouraged to redesign an existing conventional part of a machine or product for 3D printing. A professional jury will evaluate all designs submitted and assess whether they contain the distinctive features and freedom additive manufacturing has to offer.\nThe partners of the Design for Additive Manufacturing Challenge are Ultimaker, a consumer 3D printer manufacturer, Altair Engineering, leading CAE technology provider, Autodesk, a leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment software and CECIMO, European Association of the Machine Tool Industries, who are also a part of the competent jury.\nThe finalists will take home wonderful prizes like software licenses and the Winners receive besides a 3D printed Award the latest Ultimaker printer.\nAll six finalists will be invited to Additive World Conference on March 14th, 2018 in Eindhoven, where the winners of the Design Challenge 2018 will be announced during the Additive World Awards Dinner by Erik de Bruijn, co- founder of Ultimaker and chairman of the jury.\n\"We are stunned by the growing amount of the inspiring designs and the broader view on design for additive manufacturing each year\" says Erik de Bruijn. \"We are looking forward to another successful edition of the Challenge, with inspiring (re)designs to eliminate manufacturing difficulties, reduce the number of parts, minimize assembly or lower logistics costs\" adds Daan A.J. Kersten, co- founder and CEO of Additive Industries.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://additivemanufacturingtoday.com/additive-industries-launches-4th-edition-of-design-challenge","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Additive

Reichental departed 3D Systems, you could argue that this move shifted the focus of the 3D printing market. Investors and vendors appear to have turned away from consumer oriented, desktop 3D printers and are looking instead to additive manufacturing systems. The emphasis now is on how can these systems be used in a manufacturing production context.\nWhile additive manufacturing systems have always been a strong part of this industry, it\u0027s the metal additive systems that are receiving the lion\u0027s share of attention today from vendors and investors. Aerospace, medical, offshore and industrial markets continue to report on the benefits of using additive for many projects.\nIn addition, vendors continue to explore ways to improve metal additive technology, and a lot is being accomplished. Efforts are underway to improve build speed, develop new materials, and ensure repeatable quality in the parts. Plus, manufacturing customers are particularly interested in additive manufacturing and how it can be used with injection molding in a production capacity.\nIt\u0027s refreshing to see more serious attention paid to additive for manufacturing. Even so, there are questions. Just what would it look like to have additive manufacturing systems alongside CNC machining centers, injection molding systems and other equipment? Given that in the U.S., manufacturing makes up about 12% of the economy, what impact could additive machines have? Could or will additive increase the percentage of manufacturing\u0027s role in the U.S. economy? Many believe so and are working toward that goal.\nHow will additive affect the distribution network? When you can more easily produce goods locally, what effect will additive have?\nThere are no immediate answers to these questions, but there is plenty of opportunity to explore them with experts in the industry. A number of 3D printing/additive conferences exist, but two key conferences are coming up in April and May. The Additive Manufacturing Users Group conference will be in St. Louis April 3- 7. Many of the attendees at this show have years of experience working with additive systems, so there is a wealth of knowledge available here for you. This is more of an educational conference than a booth conference showcasing the latest equipment.\nTo see additive systems on display, check out SME\u0027s RAPID Show and Conference, which will take place in Orlando from May 16- 19. Vendors will be there to answer specific questions about their systems. Both events offer plenty of opportunity to explore additive technology and discuss how it could fit with your production needs.\nLeslie Langnau - Managing

Xaar received the honor for its High Laydown Technology for Material Jetting.\nVoted for by readers of 3D Printing Industry, the awards recognize individuals and enterprises leading the additive manufacturing world. They were announced at a black- tie, gala event at Nuffield Hall in London on May 17. Xaar was among representatives from more than 60 companies.\nBy ensuring that all the printhead nozzles fire at the same time, High Laydown (HL) Technology from Xaar offers massively increased material deposition rates compared to standard three- cycle printing operation. This enhances speed and productivity and allows for greater volume production speed in 3D Printing. Additionally, HL Technology allows for printing high viscosity fluids enabling the creation of 3D printed parts with higher part properties than other technologies.\n\"As 3D Printing develops to take its place as a mainstream manufacturing process it is clear that certain challenges need to be overcome, and we are very proud that Xaar\u0027s High Laydown Technology addresses two of the main challenges - namely the speed of part manufacture and the properties of parts produced,\" said Neil Hopkinson, director of 3D Printing at Xaar, and the inventor of High- Speed Sintering.\n\"To win the award for \u0027Innovation of the Year\u0027 is especially pleasing as this normally goes to a specific 3D Printing process, whereas in this case it goes to an enabling platform from which multiple, highly differentiated, processes can be created; the fact that this subtlety was appreciated by the 3D Printing Industry readership speaks volumes for the insight and credibility of this community,\" he added.\nThe 3D Printing Industry Awards are an annual gathering of the leaders in additive manufacturing. This year voting was up 35% on 2017, and the shortlists spanned all areas of the 3D Printing ecosystem - from medical, aerospace, and creative applications to 3D scanning, software and materials.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2018-05-24/xaar-wins-innovation-of-the-year-at-3d-printing-industry-awards/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Xaar

be the first ever to feature entry- into- service jet engine parts produced using additive manufacturing.\nWhile Pratt \u0026 Whitney has produced more than 100,000 prototype parts using additive manufacturing over the past 25 years - and hundreds more to support the PurePower Geared Turbofan(tm) engine family\u0027s development - the company will be the first to use additive manufacturing technology to produce compressor stators and synch ring brackets for the production engines. Pratt \u0026 Whitney PurePower PW1500G engines exclusively power the Bombardier CSeries(tm) aircraft family.\nAdditive manufacturing, also called three- dimensional (3D) printing, builds parts and products one layer at a time by printers. In 3D printing, additive processes are used, in which successive layers of material are laid down under computer control. These objects can be of almost any shape or geometry, and are produced from a 3D model or other electronic data source.\n\"Pratt \u0026 Whitney has been working with additive manufacturing since the 1980s, and we are looking forward to our upcoming milestone, when the first production PurePower PW1500G engines with parts produced through additive manufacturing will be delivered,\" said Tom Prete, Pratt \u0026 Whitney\u0027s Engineering vice president. \"We are a vertically integrated additive manufacturing producer with our own metal powder source and the printers necessary to create parts using this innovative technology. As a technology leader, we are intrigued by the potential of additive manufacturing to support our suite of technologies and benefits to customers and the global aerospace industry.\"\n\"Additive manufacturing offers significant benefits to the production of jet engines,\" said Lynn Gambill, chief engineer, Manufacturing Engineering and Global Services at Pratt \u0026 Whitney. \"We have engine tested components produced through additive manufacturing in the PW1500G.\"\nIn production tests, Pratt \u0026 Whitney has realized up to 15 months lead- time savings compared to conventional manufacturing processes and up to 50 percent weight reduction in a single part. The PurePower engine family parts will be the first product produced using 3D printing powder bed additive manufacturing.\nRelated manufacturing technologies that will be used in the PurePower engine production include Metal Injection Molding, Electron Beam Melting and Laser Powder Bed Fusion (including Direct Metal Laser Sintering).\nPratt \u0026 Whitney and the University of Connecticut are also collaborating to advance additive manufacturing research and development. The Pratt \u0026 Whitney Additive Manufacturing Innovation Center is the first of its kind in the Northeast region to work with metal powder bed technologies. With more than $4.5 million invested, the center will further advance Pratt \u0026 Whitney\u0027s additive manufacturing capabilities, while providing educational opportunities for the next generation of manufacturing engineers.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://additivemanufacturingtoday.com/pratt-whitney-pw1500g-engines-to-feature-additively-manufactured-parts","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Pratt

This platform for sharing materials, software tools and printing technologies is designed to facilitate application of additive manufacturing in industry.\nRight now, demos of the Additive Manufacturing Network are available upon request but full access is granted only through the Early Adopters Program. Partners such as Stratasys Direct Manufacturing, a 3D printing service, can use the network to find customers who require custom- printed parts as well as buy materials from vendors. Another early adopter, printing company HP, is offering access to providers of its Multi Jet Fusion 3D printer to partners in the program. HP is also working with GoProto to connect specifically with clients looking to 3D print manufacturing prototypes.\nA centralized database for 3D printing software is nothing new, but the Additive Manufacturing Network was created with the intention of streamlining material purchases and providing a central address for connecting designers, manufacturers and basically anyone who needs specially customized parts for their industry. Although there are online communities like the subreddit /r/3Dprintmything which connect individuals who want something printed with those who have 3D printers, the Additive Manufacturing Network targets companies and industries as a whole. The express goal of Siemens in introducing this network is to facilitate adoption of additive manufacturing by industries on a large scale.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/16855/Siemens-Additive-Manufacturing-Network-Targets-Industrial-Adoption-of-3D-Printing.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Siemens

One of the first industries embracing this new breed of printers is defense.\nWith the shift to Industry 4.0, 3D printing is now evolving into true additive manufacturing as illustrated by the many reports of high- volume applications in the automotive, hearing- aid, glasses, and aerospace sectors. The steady momentum underpinning additive manufacturing\u0027s adoption is propelled by its inherent advantages over today\u0027s traditional manufacturing processes.\nDefense industry benefits\nThe highly security- sensitive defense sector is ripe for additive manufacturing solutions that offer them speed (for printing parts for battlefield repairs on the fly, for example), rapid product customization capabilities, print durable and reliable components in- house, and protect their sensitive and proprietary designs. With increasing pressure to accelerate time- to- market, defense manufacturers are turning to additive manufacturing to meet deadlines in delivering the latest systems. For example, to supplement its legacy manufacturing process, Raytheon has announced goals to use additive manufacturing to 3D print almost every component of a guided weapon, including rocket engines and fins, as well as parts for guidance and control systems. Similarly, Lockheed Martin is using additive manufacturing across prototyping, tooling and production of components to rapidly implement innovation. Lockheed Martin recently announced its two- year, $5.8 million contract with the Department of Defense\u0027s executive branch, Office of Naval Research, to advance automation of industrial additive manufacturing systems.\nNext step for additive printing\nOne area where 3D printing may have the greatest impact on the defense industry, however, is in the ability to go beyond mechanical parts and additively manufacture functional electronic components in the form of 3D- printed circuit boards and antennas. Whether this is to make the final production part, perform in- field replacements and repairs, or as part of a drive towards distributed digital manufacturing at the location of need, such ubiquitous availability of on- demand additive manufacturing will lead to entirely new value chains across industry verticals.\nTraditional manufacturing of electronics introduces a security threat for industries like defense. Sending out proprietary designs or other IP to third- party firms for prototyping puts sensitive - and sometimes classified - information at risk. Additive manufacturing can ease such concerns related to sensitive information. Using additive manufacturing, defense related organizations can develop and test proprietary designs for electronics, such as antennas, circuit boards and more in- house without ever needing to resort to third- party prototyping, test or fabrication facilities. This lessens the risk of IP theft significantly and keeps costs down while significantly speeding the research and development process.\nEmerging defense applications\nAdditive manufacturing is also opening the door for a wide range of new defense applications. With additive manufacturing technology, defense developers, engineers, and product designers will eventually be able to 3D- print complete devices, with electronics printed within them. The design frontiers are virtually limitless and include geometries and other properties beyond the capabilities of traditional manufacturing processes. Devices like these might be created to replace damaged devices for military personnel on deployment, for instance.\nThe rapid prototyping capabilities of additive manufacturing of electronics completely transforms the ways product development teams work and introduces lead times far shorter - from months or weeks to days - than a custom printed circuit board (PCB) prototype that must be manufactured offsite. Having the ability to print a variety of rigid or flexible substrates, even within the same object, could lead to the discovery of totally new products, in shapes and sizes yet unimagined.\nSupply chain ripe for reinvention\nAt the product level, 3D printed electronics has the potential to play a primary role in defining the new and changing electronics needs of the defense sector, whether it\u0027s for development agility, device miniaturization, or product customization.\nAs additive manufacturing continues to proliferate, it will be seen impacting the needs of stakeholders throughout supply and value chains. A further implication of the ubiquitization of this technology is an operational one. While supply chain disintermediation is perhaps one of the most exciting promises of additive manufacturing as a whole; it is no less the case for electronics. Additive manufacturing of electronics will shake- up the old ways of making, of managing production, of warehousing, fulfillment, and production location.\nThe ability to make electronics in advanced 3D printers, using a smaller number of raw materials and parts, means that questions around where to manufacture and how to manage supply chain logistics have new potential answers. Additive manufacturing may only require an advanced deposition system, some inks and electronic components whereas traditional approaches require space for a full production line, a large range of independent and labor- intensive systems along with different laminates, hazardous chemicals and so on. The additive manufacturing route offers flexibilities that allow production to respond more quickly, more locally, more specifically, and more effectively.\nAs technologies progress it is probable that certain electrical components, particularly passives, will be additively manufactured. Anyone affected by the recent shortages of such components and the risks resulting from long lead- times can look forward to circumventing such operational risks by printing digital files that replicate the functionalities of circuit components. Imagine being able to print a multi- layer PCB, including at least some of the components, at the time and location of need, using a relatively small amount of material inputs.\nLooking ahead\nWhile additive manufacturing is not anticipated to fully replace traditional manufacturing of electronics, the defense industry can expect 3D printing to shape the future of defense products, enabling them to look and function completely differently. Precision 3D printed electronics are quickly emerging as a top priority for additive manufacturing leaders. As a critical mass of defense designers and engineers begin to explore and understand the benefits, additive manufacturing will undoubtedly be utilized to speed development, reduce costs and IP theft risk with in- house fabrication. This can be expected to de- risk innovation and thus impact on the design and functionality of next- generation electronics.\nTo cut a long story short, Bill Masters first conjured up the notion of a 3D printer in the late 70\u0027s as he was kayaking and thinking about spit balls (really!). He patented his first design in 1982 (2 years before Chuck Hull, most well known as the Father of 3D Printing ), but then lost his patents to some venture capitalists as he wasn\u0027t paying enough business attention to what was happening. He didn\u0027t even realize he was the first until years later. In a twist of fate, the universe led him to designing the first rotomolded kayak instead, and today he is largely credited for putting whitewater kayaking on the map in North America. In fact, he\u0027s just been inducted into the International White Water Hall of Fame. Today, he\u0027s still inventing everything from non- drop honey dispensers to gun cases and is trying to use his story as an educational piece for other young entrepreneurs.\nCheck him out: http://billmasters3d.com/\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Class":"0","top_articles":"21","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Global chemical company Huntsman outlined details of a new range of additive manufacturing materials that it has developed. Huntsman\u0027s IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform contains three kinds of urethane- based materials (resins, powders and filaments), which can be 3D printed using various additive manufacturing methods including stereolithography (SLA), high speed sintering (HSS) and fused filament fabrication (FFF).\nInitially, Huntsman is launching its range of soft, flexible IROPRINT additive manufacturing materials in the global footwear and sports industry, where 3D printing is being used to make both customized and mass manufactured shoes. Longer term, Huntsman plans to roll its IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform out across a much wider range of applications and industries.\nAt present, the IROPRINT additive manufacturing platform includes three product lines, which have been optimized to work with the main 3D printing techniques preferred by footwear producers.\nIROPRINT R resins are a range of soft, durable, one- component liquid resin systems that can be 3D printed using SLA, digital light processing (DLP) and other radiation- curing methods.\nFor companies looking to 3D print with powder- based materials, IROPRINT P powders are a line of high- performance thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) for HSS forms of printing.\nIROPRINT F filaments are a collection of high performance TPU materials, which have a consistent diameter, and are designed for use with fused filament fabrication (FFF) and other extrusion- based printing techniques.\nAll three IROPRINT additive manufacturing product lines have been optimized for the production of footwear components and are easy to use and print, offering advanced abrasion resistance, elongation and tear strength. For radiation- cured forms of printing such as SLA or DLP, IROPRINT R resins also offer a long pot life and quick cure capabilities.\n\"We believe the launch of our IROPRINT additive manufacturing portfolio fills a gap that exists for a range of functional, durable, yet softer 3D printing materials, which are technology agnostic, and both economical and easy to print - whatever your preferred production technique,\" says Stephane Peysson, global business development manager at Huntsman Polyurethanes.\n\"Ahead of the launch of the range, we\u0027ve been building relationships with key technology partners, which in turn work with some of the biggest footwear brands in the world,\" Peysson continues. \"Further down the line we see huge opportunities for our IROPRINT additive manufacturing materials in other sectors of the 3D printing market, from components for the automotive industry to objects for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is an incredibly exciting time to be in the additive manufacturing market, with estimates suggesting the sector is set to grow by more than 20% by 2024.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/huntsman-delivers-new-iroprintadditive-manufacturing-materials","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Huntsman Delivers new IROPRINT Additive Manufacturing Materials","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"Art:_3D Metal Printing: The Next Phase of Aircraft Manufacturing","x":4469.43798828125,"y":-2999.75439453125,"id":"1063","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"20","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"The improvement in 3D printing technology, access to more diverse materials, and precision manufacturing have made it an ideal tool for 3D printing in the aerospace industry.\n3D printing technology has come a long way from being an experimental tool used to create roughly textured objects from plastic resins. Here\u0027s a look at how 3D printing has made it into industrial contexts, specifically aerospace.\n3D printing has been embraced by many, including hobbyists and those fabricating their own products. Until recently, however, it\u0027s been unnattractive to indurstry professionals. The improvement in 3D printing technology, access to more diverse materials, and precision manufacturing, however, have made it an ideal tool for 3D printing in the aerospace industry. In particular, several companies are now actively using 3D printing to create engines, interiors, and other parts of aircraft.\nThe Federal Aviation Authority has also recognized the emergence of 3D printing in the aerospace industry, preparing for the emergence of additive manufacturing by drafting the \"Additive Manufacturing Strategic Roadmap\". The group working on the roadmap includes the US Air Force, the US Army, and NASA.\nOne of the major challenges in trying to regulate 3D printing in the aerospace industry comes from the wide variety of processes, materials, and methods being used and ensuring they all meet safety standards.\n3D printing and additive manufacturing can save companies money, streamline the manufacturing process, reduce waste, and open possibilities for more innovative designs. Here are a few examples of how 3D printing is being used in the aerospace industry right now.\nGE Additive New Printer and ATP Engine\nGE Additive, a branch of GE Technology, has recently taken the record for the largest industrial 3D printer built. The unnamed printer is capable of printing objects 1m in diameter using a 1 kW laser and thin layers of metal powder. The printer is also scalable so that even larger objects can be printed. The company intends for the printer to be used in industrial manufacturing for aircraft, automotives, and spacecraft.\nGE has already been using 3D printing for aircraft manufacturing with the Advanced Turboprop.\nBy 3D printing the ATP, the required parts for the engine were reduced from 855 to only 12. The engine will make its debut in the Cessna Denali in 2019.\nUsing 3D Printing to Bring Down Costs of the 787 Dreamliner\nBoeing has been losing money for each 787 Dreamliner they\u0027ve produced for years- nearly $30 million for each $265 million dollar plane. This is largely due to the high cost of R\u0026D and manufacturing. The design relies on the use of titanium, as opposed to aluminum, to keep the large jet airliner light and fuel efficient.\nHowever, in early 2017, Boeing partnered with Norsk Titanium to begin using 3D printed parts in the manufacturing process to bring costs down, saving Boeing $3 million for each 787 produced.\nOne of the challenges with using 3D- printed parts for aviation is that each part needs to be approved by the FAA. So far, Norsk Titanium has received FAA approval for load bearing components and hopes to receive further approval for the rest of its manufacturing process to continue to bring down the cost of each 787 produced.\nAn FAA approved 3D manufactured component for the 787 Dreamliner. Image courtesy of Norsk Titanium.\nThe cost savings from 3D printing parts for the 787 comes from the reduced cost in raw materials used, as well as a reduction in the energy requirements for manufacturing.\nIt\u0027s important to note that Norsk Titanium uses a proprietary printing method known as Rapid Plasma Deposition. In this process, titanium is melted into argon in a gaseous state to print its parts using a MERKE IV RPD machine. Given the expensive and custom nature of this form of 3D technology, it\u0027s unlikely that most industries will get their hands on it terribly soon without contracting Norsk Titanium, themselves.\nArchinaut: 3D Printing in Space\nThe advantages of 3D printing even extend beyond Earthly airspace. A company named Made in Space has been making gains in space- based 3D printing with its Archinaut project. Archinaut solves one of the most limiting factors of putting large building structures in space: size, space on launch vehicles, and the cost of launching.\nBy using a combination of 3D printing and automated, robotic devices, large structures can be printed on demand in space using polymer- alloys. This opens up a range of possibilities for manufacturing space objects, like large telescopes.\nMade in Space currently has two 3D zero- G printers on the International Space Station and plans to have their Archinaut project operational sometime in the next decade.\n3D printing has been a tool of choice for hobbyists and startups to build enclosures, but it\u0027s been generally slow to appear in professional settings. This large- scale use of 3D printing in aeronautics represents a large step for this emerging technology.\nHave you worked with 3D printing in a professional setting?

Only in a very few industries was how the part would be made and how much it might cost secondary to the function and performance. This means many parts and products were designed to fit the process they would be made from rather than the function they were intended to serve. So it was the manufacturability and process to be used, as much as the intended use and function which dictated how it looked and was designed.\nWith additive manufacturing there is a lot more freedom and it often said \"complexity comes for free\". Additive manufacturing processes all have their own limitations and design considerations but they do allow for greater flexibility when designing a part. Also we have the emergence of topology optomisation and generative design, which allow you to stipulate constraints and have the software generate design solutions. The designs generated are often organic looking shapes which would have been very difficult to manufacture conventionally but are not a problem for 3D printing.\nSo how to assess if a part is suitable for 3D printing? Here are some questions to ask;\nIs it a complicated part?\nIs it low volume?\nIs it high value?\nIs development and tooling time considerable?\nWould personalization or customisation improve it?\nIf it is many parts could it be made from less?\nIs it complicated or has simplification been forced upon it to enable manufacturability? Additive manufacturing, no matter what the process is a great choice for manufacturing complex parts and geometries. A lot of geometries which might have been almost impossible or very expensive via conventional manufacturing techniques are now possible and sometimes even cheaper via 3D printing. Compare for example the two images below. Imagine these were to be CNC machined, the second part would involve much more time and many more setups and operations. The material costs would be similar as you are starting out with two billets of a similar size but the second part requires much more material removing to realise the desired geometry. There are features on this part such as the red highlighted are which would also be difficult to achieve. Conversely part two, because it consists of much less material is better and cheaper than part one via 3D printing. This means via additive manufacturing you get a more complex, better performing part with less waste cheaper.\nIs it low volume? Additive manufacturing is an excellent choice if the part in question is going to be manufactured in low volumes or infrequently. Conventional manufacturing generally involves large upfront investments in mold tooling for example. If the part quantities are very high the cost of this tooling spread across the total number of parts is negligible and so it makes sense. But if your product is only intended to be made in low volumes the upfront cost of tooling spread over 100 parts say could make the cost per part very high.\nTake the below part for example. We will estimate the tooling costs at $5000 and the part costs $2 via injection molding. The cost for 3D printing does not vary much with quantity. In the graph below is a very simple comparison showing how 3D printing could be cost effective at lower quantities, in the below example up to about 400 parts is cheaper via 3D printing.\nIs it high value? Additive manufacturing may be more expensive for certain products but in instances where the advantages of 3D printing allow for lighter weight components and increased performance this may be justifiable. If your part or product is a high value item where performance is emphasised over cost, then 3D printing could be a viable option.\nWould the ability to personalise or customise the product make business sense? If you have a product where customization for certain groups or industries or personalization by individuals would allow you to capture more markets or make a better product the 3D printing could make this a viable option. There are a number of examples of companies new and old taking advantage of this aspect of 3D printing to create new businesses or product offerings. Some of the more famous examples might be Align, the dental aligner company and any of the 3D printed eyewear companies enabling people to have bespoke products designed to fit them.\nIs the lead time for development and manufacture long? In many industries and for many different parts and products the time taken to develop and manufacture tooling to make the product is considerable. Additive manufacturing removes the need to create mold tools to manufacture the products and can thus dramatically reduce the lead times and time to market for many products. Time is money the famous saying goes and these savings, which can often be weeks to months can add up and must be considered when calculating the cost implications of using additive manufacturing.\nIf it is many parts could it be made from less? Part consolidation is one of the most compelling reasons for moving to 3D printing today. If you can reduce the number of parts in an assembly you are saving costs in tooling, manufacture, supply chain, assembly and even inventory. You are reducing the chance of failure in a lot of occasions and improving both performance and lead time. There are obviously instances when consolidation of parts will not work, but it is such a compelling reason to use 3D printing it is more often than not worth investigation.\nIf you look at two almost identical products, one manufactured via conventional manufacturing, the other via additive then cost for cost AM will often be more expensive. But for many parts and in many instances in order to reflect the true value additive manufacturing can bring to the process one must look at the entire lifecycle of the development and use of the part. This is especially true in industries where part performance is crucial. For example if you have a cast steel part which costs $500 including tooling for the quantities used and a 3D printed part which costs twice as much at $1000 then most people would just stop there and continue to manufacture the conventional part. But if they took the design and used generative design and topology optomisation to create a light- weighted part which saved say 30% weight and thus saved $5000 over 3 years of use then the case for 3D printing this part starts to look different.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtomorrow.com/article/2018/11/how-to-evaluate-if-a-part-is-fit-for-additive-manufacturing/12495/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"How

2019 Formnext conference in Frankfurt, Germany. At its booth, DSM will showcase a plethora of new partners, materials, applications, and business solutions aimed at accelerating the adoption of 3D printing.\nAt Formnext 2019, DSM will showcase the growth of its 3D printing ecosystem across the additive manufacturing value chain. Over the past year, DSM\u0027s ecosystem expanded with a wide range of new partners, including AMT, Adaptive3D, Briggs Automotive Company (BAC), CEAD Group, CHG, Fortify, Juggerbot 3D, Stratasys, Royal HaskoningDHV, Origin, Twikit, Inkbit, and Voxel8. Together with these partners, DSM explores a broad range of new applications, including prosthetics and orthotics, automotive, infrastructure, post- processing, and footwear and apparel.\nDSM believes expanding its 3D printing ecosystem is critical to unlock the full potential of additive manufacturing. DSM\u0027s ecosystem was further strengthened in 2019 with the launch of the I AM Tomorrow Challenge, a program enabling tech players to build the digital ecosystem to transform additive manufacturing.\nWide range of applications on display\nEyecatchers at this year\u0027s Formnext will no doubt include the BAC Mono R supercar. A combination of the award- winning design expertise of BAC and DSM\u0027s 3D printing expertise, the car illustrates to the traditional automotive industry what lightweight sustainable solutions can be. Also on display will be a four meter 3D printed bridge - codeveloped by DSM, Royal HaskoningDHV and CEAD Group - the next generation of the world\u0027s first polymer 3D printed pedestrian bridge printed earlier this year.\nAt its booth, DSM will also showcase small- size applications and end- to- end solutions, such as a digital workflow for 3D printed prosthetics and orthotics codeveloped with several partners.\nDSM\u0027s booth is organized to reflect four distinct market needs: materials that are \u0027structural\u0027, \u0027durable\u0027, \u0027flexible\u0027, and that \u0027optimize/accelerate design\u0027 - and showcases a broad selection of applications across these four categories.\nThe showcased materials include two materials innovations which help bring DSM\u0027s offering closer to its goal of sustainable manufacturing:\nA glass- reinforced PET material for fused granulate fabrication (FGF) printing, Arnite(r) AM8527 (G), used in the 3D printed pedestrian bridge.\nThe first PBT powder available for selective laser sintering (SLS), Arnite(r) T AM1210 (P). A well- known material in the manufacturing industry, the powder\u0027s dielectric properties open the door to 3D printing applications requiring electrical insulation. Recyclable and with a high reusability rate, the material presents itself as an attractive solution for environmentally conscious manufacturers.\nHugo da Silva, VP Additive Manufacturing DSM: \"DSM\u0027s story at Formnext is one of market focus and material expertise, but it is also a story of collaboration across the 3D printing value chain. Manufacturers today look for a partner who can help scale 3D printing from experimental prototyping to industrial workflows. This requires the ability to navigate the increasingly complex 3D printing landscape. By matching material science, people, and insights, we translate application needs to tailored, end- to- end 3D printing solutions, effectively removing the barriers that prevent manufacturers from adopting or scaling 3D printing - unlocking the full potential of additive manufacturing.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID\u003d52578","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"DSM Showcases Success in Scaling 3D Printing with Wide Array of Partnerships, New Materials, and 3D Printed Applications","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"chicago","x":-3864.645751953125,"y":-3804.398193359375,"id":"328","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"13","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"27","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"66","initial_node_score":"4.33072658861056","real_tf_idf":"5.654","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(80,115,206)","size":25.0},{"label":"3d material","x":3129.208740234375,"y":1413.9957275390625,"id":"717","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"2","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"82","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"5","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"17","initial_node_score":"0.5972073054872453","real_tf_idf":"1.995","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(231,73,235)","size":20.0},{"label":"Art:_DSM acquires part of Clariant’s 3D printing materials portfolio","x":-3356.43359375,"y":1268.8348388671875,"id":"1099","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"56","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Global nutritional science firm and material producer DSM has taken over a portion of specialty chemical company Clariant\u0027s additive manufacturing (AM) materials business.\nClariant has deemed its 3D printing materials division to no longer be in line with its strategic vision, and agreed to cede control over a selection of its filament and pellet materials, and part of its 3D printing team. For ASM, the partial takeover will enable the company to better serve its customers rapid product development needs, with 3D printing filaments and pellets that meet the requirements of specific applications.\n\"We are very excited about welcoming the new team members and the expertise they bring to expand our service offering,\" said Hugo da Silva, Vice President of Additive Manufacturing at DSM. \"We share the same focus on customer needs and have complementary expertise and portfolio. Together we can fulfil market needs faster and with a broader materials toolbox, and realize further the potential of additive manufacturing to the manufacturing world.\"\nThe expansion of Clariant\u0027s materials business\nClariant\u0027s agreement with DSM represents a change of direction for the company, which had been expanding its 3D printing materials business since 2017. The company launched a division dedicated to the development of AM materials in December that year, which began devising a new range of high- grade filaments for 3D printing.\nContinuing to broaden the reach of its materials portfolio, Clariant joined Ultimaker\u0027s Materials Partner Network in April 2018, which saw its filaments utilized across multiple polymer 3D printing disciplines. Following this, in July 2018, the company listed R\u0026D vacancies at its Guangzhou base in China, with the specific role of \"creating and optimizing an innovative range of 3D printing materials.\" Clariant went on to display a new range of industrial 3D printing materials at Formnext 2018, including a green- blue ColorWorks filament, flame retardants, glass fibers and light stabilizers.\nNonetheless, in August 2018, Clariant began to seek a way of cost- sharing within its material business, via a proposed merger with Saudi Arabian chemicals company SABIC. While both companies had an interest in 3D printer filaments, the deal was called off by SABIC, which cited \"unfavorable market conditions.\" The Saudi company later reported a net loss of $101 million for the first six months of 2019, and the deal was never revisited.\nDSM\u0027s acquisition deal\nThe latest agreement sees DSM take over Clariant\u0027s portfolio and pipeline of engineering- grade filament and pellet materials. While Clariant will continue to serve users of 3D printing with flame retardant and high- quality additives, much of its team\u0027s expertise will be handed over. DSM in turn, will inherit Clariant\u0027s customer relations and 3D printing teams, whose knowledge of powder development, will help customers to develop materials that match their existing product portfolio and production processes.\nThrough integrating part of Clariant\u0027s portfolio into its own, DSM will also be better positioned to address its customers\u0027 needs, by rapidly adapting high performance filaments and pellets for specific markets. Moreover, DSM believes that the deal represents a considerable expansion of its materials and services offering. The Dutch company has inherited a dedicated, flexible, high- speed compounding setup, and a small production line which will enable it to quickly ramp- up the manufacturing of small product batches.\n\"After thorough strategic review, Clariant concluded that its 3D printing materials business was no longer aligned with its strategic focus,\" said Richard Haldimann, Head of Sustainability Transformation at Clariant. \"While we will continue to serve the 3D printing market with our high quality additives and flame retardants, we are confident that DSM is the ideal new home for parts of Clariant\u0027s tailored 3D printing materials business to continue its successful development. I look forward to seeing them thrive.\"\nDSM\u0027s growing role in 3D printing material production\nWhile DSM\u0027s acquisition deal will significantly expand its offering to customers, the company has already made advances in 3D printing via a series of partnerships over the last few years.\nIn March 2020 for instance, DSM partnered with 3D printing engineering and consulting firm JuggerBot 3D to explore the potential of Fused Granulate Fabrication (FGF) technology. The companies co- developed pellet 3D printers and materials for production applications.\nWorking with San Francisco- based 3D printing startup Origin, DSM optimized photopolymer materials for Origin\u0027s programmable P3 3D printing platform in May 2019. The first material to be developed under the partnership was the Somos(r) PerFORM HW, a composite with a tensile strength of 80 MPa and resistance to high temperatures of up to 260degC.\nA collaboration with large- scale 3D printer supplier CEAD in May 2019, saw DSM develop new feedstock, tooling and end- use applications for FGF 3D printing. By expanding its range of FGF 3D printing materials, the company aimed to provide flexibility to its customers in choosing the material and technology that best suited their desired application.\nYou can now nominate for the 2020 3D Printing Industry Awards.

The acquisitions could massively disrupt the current industry trajectory, experts say, and accelerate the use of metal additive manufacturing in several areas.\nThe two companies each bring different, but complementary, 3D printing functions, David Joyce, president and CEO of GE Aviation, said in a press release. Arcam AB, based in Molndal, Sweden, owns an electron beam melting machine and produces metal powders for aerospace and healthcare manufacturing. SLM Solutions Group, in Lubeck, Germany, builds laser machines, also for metal- based 3D printing, used in the aerospace, automotive, energy, and healthcare industries.\nSince 2010, GE has invested close to $1.5 billion in 3D printing technologies for manufacturing. \"The investment has enabled the company to develop additive applications across six GE businesses, create new services applications across the company, and earn 346 patents in powder metals alone,\" the press release stated. The company expects to grow its 3D printing manufacturing business to $1 billion by 2020.\nSEE: How GE is using 3D printing to unleash the biggest revolution in large- scale manufacturing in over a century\nGE\u0027s potential acquisitions of Arcam and SLM marks a seminal moment for industrial 3D printing, according to Rick Smith, co- founder and CEO of Fast Radius, an on- demand manufacturing company backed by UPS.\n\"GE has been a leader in applying 3D printing for game- changing internal applications,\" Smith said. \"These acquisitions mean that GE is now convinced of the broader disruption that is coming to global manufacturing and supply chains, as thousands of other companies begin to aggressively adopt these technologies. This validation from one of the most respected industrial companies in the world will send ripple effects across the entire industry.\"\nIndeed, industrial 3D printing continues to become more popular, with global spending on printers reaching nearly $11 billion in 2015. Spending is predicted to rise to about $27 billion by 2019, according to International Data Corporation.\nAbout two- thirds of US manufacturers are now adopting 3D printing in some way, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report. Half are using it for prototyping and final products. And 52% of manufacturers expect 3D printing to be used for high- volume production in the next 3- 5 years, the report found.\n\"Additive provides a new palette for engineers to create. Parts are also being designed in GE Power, Oil \u0026 Gas, Healthcare and across GE\u0027s services businesses,\" said Joyce in the press release. \"We see value potential to reduce product cost... Ultimately, as we develop more productive machines, we can build additive manufacturing \u0027as a service\u0027 for our customers.\"\nGE Aviation began selling 3D- printed fuel nozzle interiors for jet engines in July. More than 11,000 of such engines are currently on order with up to 20 fuel nozzles in each, the company stated, with production expected to rise to more than 40,000 fuel nozzles by 2020. The company is also creating 3D- printed military engine components.\n\"I believe GE\u0027s acquisitions of two of the leading metal additive manufacturing system developers will significantly accelerate the realization of metal additive manufacturing as a next- generation advanced manufacturing technology,\" said Scott Dunham, vice president of research at SmarTech Markets Publishing and a 3D printing industry analyst.\nWhile leaders in metal additive manufacturing system development have been growing their capabilities for the past five years, they have been slow to integrate into mainstream manufacturing, Dunham said.\nBy combining Arcam AB and SLM with GE, a global multi- billion dollar manufacturer that has a lot of experience using metal 3D printing machines for manufacturing applications, Dunham said he would \"expect an acceleration in the timeline in widespread implementation of metals- based additive manufacturing across a number of industries, thanks to the combination of end- user experience, process- specific expertise, and a significant global presence in manufacturing.\"\nGE is currently making the necessary filings to acquire each company. It plans to continue using the headquarters and key operating locations of both Arcam and SLM, and retain each company\u0027s employees, the press release stated.\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\nGeneral Electric announced plans to purchase additive manufacturing companies Arcam AB and SLM Solutions group for a total of $1.4 billion on Tuesday, in a move experts say will accelerate the use of such technologies in mainstream manufacturing.\nSince 2010, GE has invested about $1.5 billion in additive manufacturing technologies, and plans to grow its 3D printing manufacturing business to $1 billion by 2020.\nIndustrial 3D printing is growing, with about two- thirds of US manufacturers currently adopting 3D printing in some way, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report.\nAlso see\nWhy 3D printing is to manufacturing as computers were to the workplace: A conversation with Bob McCutcheon (TechRepublic)","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-makes-1-4b-bet-on-3d-printing-acquires-two-firms-to-boost-additive-manufacturing/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"GE makes $1.4B bet on 3D printing, acquires two firms to boost additive manufacturing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"Art:_Sculpteo Releases 2019 State of 3D Printing","x":-5553.90478515625,"y":4084.43359375,"id":"1117","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"74","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Sculpteo, a leading online 3D printing service, recently ran a survey of 1,300 individuals across a range of industries that asked a myriad of questions about their applications of 3D printing; the results of the survey were used to create the 5th edition of the annual State of 3D Printing report. As a provider services, Sculpteo prizes this type of feedback as it becomes significantly easier to meet the needs of customers when those customers specifically tell you what they need.\nHow is 3D printing used?\nA primary question of the survey asked how the respondents used 3D printing. Not surprisingly, 70% of those surveyed reported using 3D printing for prototyping. And while it will come as no surprise to our readers, others may be shocked to learn that 51% said they used 3D printing for production. 3D printing will always be used heavily in prototyping, but its use in production and manufacturing is quickly catching up in adoption.\nAnother 63% use 3D printing for proof of concept, which allows engineers to test and demonstrate the viability/effectiveness of a product or component in a fast, cost- effective way. Nearly 50% are using 3D printing for research and development or education purposes. 40% are making on- demand spare parts while some 32% create marketing samples with 3D printing.\nThe benefits of using 3D printing\nWhen asked what benefits they experience from using 3D printing, 67% pointed to the ability to fabricate complex geometries. 41% indicated that 3D printing reduced lead times on product development and manufacturing, and 43% said it enabled quick iterations. 37% reported cost reduction and 22% listed mass reduction, which is perhaps much of the same 13% that noted simplified assembly. Around 37% felt that mass customization was a benefit of 3D printing, a number that is likely to continue to grow in the future.\nDemographics \u0026 Industries\nRegionally, 59% of those surveyed live in Europe, followed by Asia with 20% and North America accounting for 17%. The great majority (39%) of users are 25 to 34 years old, indicating that 3D printing is still a relatively young technology that will be heavily adopted as the next wave of graduates enter the labor force with educations that included additive manufacturing. Speaking of education, 3D printing users are highly educated, with 41% having a Master\u0027s degree and another 11% sporting a Doctorate. 65% have a degree in engineering, though business majors use 3D printing more than science and math majors, at 10% and 8% respectively.\nUse by industry breaks down as follows:\nIndustrial goods - 13.6%\nTech - 10.6%\nServices - 10%\nConsumer goods- 8.6%\nHealthcare/Medical - 6.2%\nAutomotive - 5.7%\nAerospace - 5.5%\nEducation - 5%\nOther - 15.6%\nPlastics and resins comprise most of the material usage according to the survey, at 98% and 82%. More than 75% are using metal now. Plastics are the only category of material where more respondents report using in- house 3D printing rather than external services. There\u0027s also a large discrepancy between the percentage of individuals who use in- house FDM 3D printers, which is 74%, and that of any other AM technology, with the next- highest being SLA at only 30%.\nAlmost half of the respondents said that quality control is one of the top challenges of using 3D printing. Other popular responses were file preparation (33%), maintenance (27%), and price quoting (26%). Cost of entry came out as the top factor that may hinder adoption, tallying 68% of responses, and 57% believe that a knowledge gap will slow further expansion.\nThese insights are largely in line with other recent reports on 3D printing. Most professionals are using 3D printing for prototyping and proof of concept applications but a growing number are integrating 3D printing into end- use applications of production, manufacturing, personalization, and presentation. In fact, 53% of respondents feel that AM will have a significant role in manufacturing, business, and personal life.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://3dprinting.com/news/sculpteo-releases-2019-state-of-3d-printing/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Sculpteo Releases 2019 State of 3D Printing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"aircraft","x":4560.828125,"y":-1116.651611328125,"id":"196","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"13","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"4","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"4","num_appearance":"123","initial_node_score":"10.505703881150112","real_tf_idf":"14.161","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":30.0},{"label":"am system","x":3382.000732421875,"y":-810.2733764648438,"id":"596","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"64","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"32","initial_node_score":"1.1061484897509217","real_tf_idf":"3.325","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_The market share is increasing and more production industries are acquiring 3D printing units.

Not only does it have the potential to create something through an entirely unique process, but it also has the capability to render some production lines useless. If consumers are able to 3D print their favorite everyday consumer goods using a 3D printer at home, the manufacturing industries will face a serious drawback. On a different note, 3D printing has opened up new opportunities for production, factory maintenance, and R\u0026D, since acquiring spares for a machine has never been easier. 3D printing is a technology with a mixed impression, but most people are noticing that the pros will outweigh the cons.\n3D Printing in R\u0026D\nResearch and development departments require prototypes, often times, a lot of them. In a typical setup, prototypes are handcrafted or made from molds, which takes up a lot of the designer\u0027s precious time. Using 3D printed prototypes, designers are able to save both time and money.\nProdrive is a company that manufactures equipment and technologies related to motorsports, and they have incorporated using 3D printing for R\u0026D for a long time now. Since 2009, Prodrive has been using 3D printing to create automobile models with Prodrive goodies installed providing the team with a better idea of the project in its entirety. It also gave the team a physical model to examine, not just a computer rendering. Many other companies have began seeing the potential of 3D printing models, even Aston Martin goes along the same path when it comes to an effective R\u0026D strategy planning.\nAdditive Manufacturing seems to be quite the buzzword in today\u0027s manufacturing industry. The usual manufacturing process is mostly a subtractive process, where the raw material gets wasted and reused over and over again. For example, in a car factory sheet metal is cut and shaped into specific body parts and leftover metal is later melted back down and formed into metal plates again before they can be reused for any further processes.\nOn the other hand, 3D printing is a very precise manufacturing process. Whatever is designed is 3D- printed using the raw materials, no cutting down, no leftover material, no need to reprocess the materials. Therefore, it\u0027s only an additive process and not subtractive. By being an additive process, 3D manufacturing reduces material waste, as well as processing time and required equipment.\n3D printing undoubtedly impacts the material and production cost in a production environment. Depending on the purpose, the price of a 3D printer can be between $5,000 to $500,000 depending on the purpose and material requirements. However, in a massive manufacturing setup, the ROI would certainly make up for the cost. An industry that has migrated fully to 3D printing would hit the breakeven point significantly quicker than integrating other process technologies.\nCreative Way of Getting More Done\nNow that a lot of time is saved by precise prototyping using 3D printing, the companies may put more effort into getting things done the right way in lesser time. A lot of the ROI could potentially be saved so that companies might make some investment in sectors they don\u0027t usually do. Such experiments with the finances are supposed to bring the company benefits, without conducting a full- fledged cost analysis on every end. Being able to easily and cheaply make prototypes allows companies to really get creative, and the budget is a little more lenient to allow for trial and error.\nMost of the countries in the world now have very bold and strict environmental laws for industry to protect the community around them, as well as nature in general. By using additive manufacturing strategy, 3D printing can actively contribute to lesser carbon emission. Many of the aerospace manufacturers now use 3D printing to produce modules that require precise cut and structural uniformity. By doing so, they reduce wasting raw material and eventually the CO2 emission to nature is reduced by a significant amount. Some 3D printers can actually use recycled wood, reducing the environmental effect of what little waste does occur.\nWhat does the future look like?\n3D printing\u0027s future is bright nonetheless, but somewhat unpredictable at the same time. The market share is increasing and more production industries are acquiring 3D printing units. Subtractive manufacturing has been rendered less effective, but there are many industries that are reluctant to give up their old ways. 3D printing will most likely take over the R\u0026D and maintenance sectors for production, but taking over the entire production facility will certainly take some time.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtomorrow.com/article/2018/03/how-3d-printing-is-impacting-manufacturing/11190/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"The market share is increasing and more production industries are acquiring 3D printing units.

printingAdditive Manufacturing\nThe UAE has 3D printing capabilities firmly in its sights.\nAccording to Dubai Future, 3D printing is set to become truly pervasive in everyday life, and will create huge economic value. The Dubai 3D Printing Strategy, as set out by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, aims to use additive manufacturing to reduce labour by 70 percent, costs by 90 percent, and time by 80 percent across sectors. By 2025, every new building in Dubai will be at least 25 percent 3D printed, starting at two percent in 2019 and gradually growing in capability. The national health authority will also experiment with 3D printing in the pursuit of perfecting prosthetics.\nThe UAE- based company Immensa Technology Labs is marking its territory by launching Dubai\u0027s first 3D printing facility, which contains more than eight additive manufacturing systems and over 30 materials.\nThe business established itself in 2016 in order to advance the 3D printing capabilities of the region in line with His Highness\u0027s plan. It is equipped to design and create high- quality parts and prototypes, and will be a flagship of higher technology for the region.\nAccording to Trade Arabia, Fahmi Al Shawwa (Chief Executive of

Class":"0","top_articles":"37","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Essentium, Inc., a leading provider of 3D printing technology for additive manufacturing, today announced it is partnering with LEHVOSS Group, a leading innovator of chemical and mineral specialties, to develop high- performance materials for industrial- scale additive manufacturing. Created specifically for extrusion- based 3D printing processes, the materials meet the standards required for industry applications in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, biomedical and electronic manufacturing sectors.\nThe high cost of 3D printing materials has been a significant obstacle hindering additive manufacturing innovation. In addition, the low performance of materials optimized but not developed for 3D printing has inhibited additive manufacturing success. Manufacturers want polymers they trust and that offer certified standards in their applications.\nEssentium and LEHVOSS are addressing this challenge by combining LEHVOSS\u0027 extensive experience in thermoplastic high- performance compounds with Essentium\u0027s expertise in polymer and composite chemistry to develop engineering- grade materials precisely tuned and certified for a wide range of industry applications.\nAfter two years of collaborative research and development, Essentium has launched a line of PEEK and High- Temperature Nylon (HTN) materials using LUVOCOM(r) 3F compounds. The materials offer easy printability and non- warping properties, as well as heat and chemical resistance and high mechanical strengths, enabling quality end- parts that can withstand the rigors of the factory floor. Certified on the Essentium High Speed Extrusion (HSETM) 3D Printing Platform, the materials are suitable for applications such as mechanical engineering, medical technology and parts subject to high stresses for the engine compartment and drive train in the automotive sector.\nSupporting Quotes:\nThomas Collet, Director 3D Printing Materials \u0026 Marketing, LEHVOSS Group: \"Partnering with Essentium is a win- win for our industrial customers. Essentium is at the forefront of material science and together we will create a wider range of 3D printing materials certified to meet the performance standards they expect in their end- use parts. Not only will this speed time- to- market and lower the cost to produce the highest quality parts, it will also spur innovation for new additive manufacturing applications.\"\nBrandon Sweeney, Ph.D., Head of R\u0026D for Materials and Co- founder, Essentium, Inc.: \"While there are many compounding companies that optimize materials for 3D printing, few can rival LEHVOSS\u0027 manufacturing knowledge and their approach for designing compounds specifically for extrusion- based 3D printing processes. With LEHVOSS we have a true partner who shares our passion in applying material science innovation to accelerate industrial- scale additive manufacturing. We have already seen strong demand for our PEEK and HTN materials and look forward to developing new materials that give manufacturers the trust and confidence to shift from prototyping to full- scale production using 3D printing.\"\nAbout LEHVOSS Group\nThe LEHVOSS Group under the management of Lehmann\u0026Voss\u0026Co. is a group of companies in the chemicals sector that develops, produces and markets chemical and mineral specialities for various industrial clients.

(AM), once thought of as a prototyping technology, has graduated to become a way to manufacture end- use parts. Pioneering automotive and aerospace firms are using it to build lightweight shapes with lattice structures, to consolidate multi- part assemblies into a single 3D- printed component, and to incorporate composite materials.\nIn this LIVE roundtable moderated by DE editor Kenneth Wong, panelists discuss:\nChallenges of applying 3D printing to large- scale parts and structures\nModeling tools for sculpting 3D- printable shapes\nMethods for simulating the 3D printing process\nPanelists will address attendees\u0027 questions during the LIVE Q\u0026A session.\nTo register, go to: http://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1405041/DD36372676B02D4B4E8693A8B195A3A9\nAdditive Manufacturing \u0026 Design Graduate Program, Pennsylvania State University\nDr. Tim Simpson has taught 3D printing for nearly 20 years. His passion for the technology was reignited five years ago when he saw his kids\u0027 excitement at printing pink tiaras, ninja stars, and even their own heads on plastic figurines at home. With the recent advancements in 3D metal printing, Simpson feels like a child himself, questioning everything that he has seen and learned about manufacturing and design. As co- director of the Penn State\u0027s CIMP- 3D Center, Dr. Simpson enjoys blowing people\u0027s minds with the lab\u0027s state- of- the- art metal 3D printing systems, which have fabricated everything from aircraft parts, to engine pistons, to knee implants, to custom watch cases. His goal is to train anyone and everyone to use 3D printing to disrupt and rethink manufacturing and design as we know it.\nAnalyst, SmarTech Markets Publishing\nDavide Sher has extensive experience as a technology journalist and communication consultant. Born in Milan, Italy, Davide spent 12 years in the U.S., where he received his B.A. He now lives in Milan. In 2016, he founded 3D Printing Business Media Ltd., based in London, UK. In 2016, he joined SmarTech Publishing, an industry analysis and market forecasts provider for the 3D printing/additive manufacturing industry, as the Senior Analyst for 3DP Adoption Studies.\nRyan Lozier\nAM Engineer, Caterpillar Inc.\nA Purdue University graduate, Ryan Lozier came to Caterpillar from Zimmer Biomet Orthopedics, where he was a manufacturing engineer for their Patient Specific Instrument Additive Manufacturing cell. In his current role at Caterpillar as AM engineer for the Analytics and Innovation Division, he is responsible for design for AM education, process development of Powderbed Fusion printing, and research in design and simulation tools for AM.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/before-you-hit-3d-print-a-live-roundtable-on-industrial-3d-printing","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Before

the years, we\u0027ve covered a number of firsts in 3D printing. The first commercial use of the term 3D printer (1996), the first working 3D printed kidney (2000), the first self- replicating 3D printer kit (2004), the first 3D printed prototype car body (2010), the first general consumer- focused 3D printer (2012) and the first 3D printer in space (2014), to name a few. But now the firsts are breaking out of R\u0026D labs and being made by big businesses.\nBoeing, with the help of Norsk Titanium, just received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to use 3D printed parts in its 787 Dreamliner. It\u0027s the first time a plane will use 3D- printed metals as structural components. Adidas and Carbon worked together using Carbon\u0027s Digital Light Synthesis technology to create the Futurecraft 4D midsole. Adidas released more than 300 of the new 3D printed shoes last month and plans to produce more than 5,000 this year and 100,000+ by the end of 2018. Caterpillar recently opened a 3D Printing \u0026 Innovation Accelerator and announced a partnership with FIT AG, known for creating the Netfabb 3D printing software company that it sold to Autodesk. Ford is the first automaker to pilot the Stratasys Infinite Build 3D printer, which is capable of very large builds. GE Additive, which calls itself the world\u0027s leading digital industrial company, has invested about $1.5 billion in manufacturing and additive technologies at GE\u0027s Global Research Center. It wants to grow its new additive business to $1 billion by 2020 and sell 10,000 additive machines over the next 10 years. Google Ventures and BMW iVentures are among the investors in Desktop Metal, a start- up developing the first desktop 3D printers that can create metal parts.\nThe Business Case for Industrial 3D Printing\nThe list goes on and on. What they all have in common is combining the manufacturing and supply chain experience of big businesses with the technology and expertise of additive manufacturing providers. Whether working directly with, investing in, or simply purchasing 3D printing technology vendors outright, it\u0027s clear that big business is ready to fully embrace 3D printing.\nThe momentum of \"digitalization\"- connecting all phases of a product lifecycle throughout and beyond the enterprise via a digital thread- can only further the adoption of industrial 3D printing/additive manufacturing. It\u0027s a huge undertaking for any enterprise, and direct digital manufacturing is only part of it. In the past, some wrote off 3D printing as a solution in search of a problem. Now, some of the challenges of digitalization- such as mass customization, connected automation and realizing the benefits of topology optimization- are big problems 3D printing can help solve.\nThe benefits to industrial 3D printing, given the right circumstances, are well documented. The time and cost savings, coupled with less tangible notions of \"free\" design complexity and fewer manufacturing constraints, make 3D printing a no- brainer for sectors that specialize in short- run production of custom parts. But beyond expensive aerospace and racecar parts, or custom medical and dental applications lies mass market manufacturing. The extent to which 3D printing can penetrate those markets depends largely on how much faster it can get, how much larger build volumes become and how many engineers know how to design for a future that melds additive and subtractive technologies.\nDesigning for Additive Manufacturing\nAs we\u0027ve noted in the past, design engineers need new tools and thought processes to design and simulate for additive manufacturing. Everything from material options to model prep to post- processing follows traditional manufacturing process rules, requirements and tribal knowledge developed over generations. Rapid prototyping \u0026 manufacturing service providers can help fill the knowledge gap and design software vendors are making great strides in providing better tools for 3D printing. Still, for 3D printing to reach the levels being forecast by industry analysts, the comfort level of design engineers, old and young, is just as important as an acceptance of its benefits by CEOs or its ability to meet technical challenges.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/big-business-gets-additive-manufacturing","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Big

However, the best use for 3D printing in manufacturing is still contested. Some herald it as a total replacement for mass production: you want something, you print it. Others see it as a useful prototyping tool with little viability on the production floor. But what is 3D printing\u0027s place, really?\nTo answer that, we asked Rush LaSelle, director of digital manufacturing at JABIL inc. With 175,000 employees worldwide, JABIL is a massive multi- sector company that specializes in design engineering, supply chain management and logistics and manufacturing.\nAccording to LaSelle, identifying the value in emerging technologies is essential to gaining an advantage in the marketplace. Correctly applying leading technology can make your products better and help them get to market faster.\nSo, where does additive manufacturing fit in?\nAdditive manufacturing may never be able to match the low cost or speed of injection molding (yes, companies like HP are working on making the process faster), but additive has other advantages over other production processes.\nAdditive Advantage: Mass Customization\n3D printing doesn\u0027t require molds or special tooling.\nConsider two custom medical implants, such as dentures: each print takes basically the same time to produce, whether the machine prints two identical pieces or two totally different pieces, since you aren\u0027t cutting metal for injection molding.\nQuickly and cheaply producing customized products in this way is a huge opportunity, and we\u0027re seeing it happen with companies like FitStation.\nAdditive Advantage: Reducing Batch Size\nDistributing manufacturing helps get products to market faster. 3D printing can help take manufacturing out of monolithic factories overseas and bring it closer to home.\nFor example, printing car parts right next to the production line could reduce warehousing and inventory costs.\nAdditive Advantage: De- Risking\nWith injection molding, design failures are expensive. With 3D printing, you can produce multiple iterations in the time it would take to cut a new mold. This opens up opportunities for designers to try new things and explore the limitations of the technology.\nThe Role of Additive in the Production Process\nSo, what is the rightful place of additive manufacturing?\nAccording to Rush LaSelle, additive may never replace injection molding in applications requiring high volumes of identical parts. However, as designers and engineers explore the full potential of the technology, we will find the optimal role of 3D printing in industrial manufacturing.\nIf you liked this video, click here to

By the end of 2013, it reached EUR2.2 billion or $3 billion. It is projected to reach EUR4.5 billion or $6.1 billion by 2018, and EUR7.7 billion or $10.5 billion by 2023, as we can see in the graph below.\nTimes of rapid changes\nThis projection is reflected in the market capitalization of companies that work in the area of 3D printing. More and more companies are experiencing a transition from analog to digital manufacturing, recognizing cost savings and design benefits. Additive manufacturing is rapidly replacing traditional manufacturing. This fast transition is pushing traditional manufacturing toward extinction. The sluggishness of traditional manufacturing will also become expensive as ROI and product delivery time are faster in additive manufacturing. Therefore, traditional manufacturing is no longer going to offer advantages to anyone, and it soon will become obsolete.\nLeaders in market capitalization\nAccording to Statista, 3D Systems has reached a market capitalization of $6.8 million followed by ExOne, a global provider of 3D printing machines and 3D printed products to industrial customers, which describes itself as a pioneer of non- traditional industrial manufacturing, with a market capitalization of around $609 million. Voxelijet comes in at $537 million and Alphaform at $23 million as of February 2014.\nAnd growing...\nAccording to a press release, Alphaform reported a revenue increase of around 14.4 percent to Q1 2014 to EUR7.5 million compared with the same period of previous year. Recently, Barron\u0027s published an article titled \"3D Printer Stocks Are Suddenly Hot Again\" (registration required) highlighting how 3D printing and robotics stocks are gaining momentum.\nAll this is clear evidence of the great support the additive manufacturing industry is receiving, and, as we have seen through the projection above, it will only increase. Additive manufacturing has started to be considered as the answer to restoring manufacturing in some countries. (See 3D Printing Might Bring Manufacturing Back to Canada.)\nMass production of 3D printed parts in sand, metal, or glass in industrial manufacturing is rapidly replacing traditional manufacturing. The already existing mass production of such parts on demand saves time and money for industrial manufacturers. The benefits of additive manufacturing over traditional manufacturing are too many and too good to be ignored.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.ebnonline.com/global-3d-printing-growth-will-change-manufacturing/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Global 3D

manufacturing (WAAM) and big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) are two of the most common approaches for 3D printing at large scales, but they aren\u0027t the only game in town.\nIn many ways, the state of large- scale additive manufacturing today resembles that of 3D printing more broadly at the turn of the millennium. In that bygone era, the excitement surrounding 3D printing as a production technology was almost palpable. The optimists dreamed of replacing turning centers, 5- axis machines- even whole factories- with nothing but 3D printers. As the fervor reached its peak, we seemed poised to enter a new age of additive manufacturing. Yet, despite all the enthusiasm, that revolution never came.\nNow, you might claim that the fourth industrial revolution is still on its way, or that the use of 3D printing as a production technology is still growing, just not as quickly as initially expected. Hype is often the result of focusing on new technologies in the abstract without considering all the nuances involved, which naturally leads to overly inflated expectations. A better understanding of the underlying engineering tends to temper the hype.\nStill, even if 3D printing isn\u0027t going to supplant all of the more traditional manufacturing methods, it seems uncontroversial that additive manufacturing will continue to proliferate throughout the sector. Metal additive manufacturing has certainly made some serious leaps forward in the last few years, but rather than focusing specifically on materials, it\u0027s worth considering an even more fundamental aspect of 3D printing: build volume.\nAre large- scale 3D printers the gateway for additive manufacturing in production?\nHow Large Are the Largest 3D Printers?\nIf we\u0027re going to discuss large- scale additive manufacturing, we need to be clear on what that means. Stratasys\u0027 H2000 was introduced at IMTS 2016 as the Infinite Build 3D Demonstrator. This machine holds the top spot for industrial 3D printers in terms of build volume, since it\u0027s theoretically capable of producing parts with infinite lengths. However, since you still won\u0027t find it outside of a few pilot projects, a better candidate for defining the upper limit of large- scale additive manufacturing is the Cincinnati Incorporated BAAM system. BAAM systems are available in two sizes: 140 in x 65 in x 34 in and 240 in x 90 in x 72 in. voxeljet AG\u0027s VX4000 is another contender for largest industrial 3D printer- the company billed it as the largest industrial 3D printer in North America when it was installed at voxeljet\u0027s Canton, MI facility in 2016. With a build envelope measuring 157 in x 79 in x 39 in, the VX4000 was designed for printing sand molds used in the casting of large components.\n(There are several other 3D printers with larger build volumes than the BAAM and voxeljet systems- such as those of D- Shape and XtreeE- but since these are intended for construction, they lie beyond the scope of this article.)\nFor metal 3D printing, the largest commercially available machine is Sciaky\u0027s EBAM (electron beam additive manufacturing) 300 Series, with a build volume of 228 in x 48 in x 96 in. GE Additive\u0027s Project ATLAS (additive technology large area system) is the largest powder bed fusion (PBF) system, at 43 in x 43 in x 12 in, but it\u0027s still in beta testing. For the moment, the largest PBF machine is the Xline 2000R from Concept Laser, acquired by GE in 2016, at 31 in x 16 in x 20 in. Setting a lower limit for large- scale 3D printing is more difficult. Desktop units- such as those from Ultimaker- obviously don\u0027t count as large format, but what about HP\u0027s Multi Jet Fusion series? Drawing a dividing line for metal 3D printing is even more challenging, since you don\u0027t find the same radical differences in scale at the extremes- barring some unusual exceptions.\nI suspect we have a bit of a sorites paradox on our hands. So, rather than setting an arbitrary lower limit on build volume, I propose to adopt the following 20- Questions- inspired convention: a 3D printer only counts as large- format if it can produce parts that are bigger than a breadbox.\nThis at least gives us a starting point from which to consider the focal question of this article: Are bigger 3D printers the way forward for additive manufacturing in production?\nTypes of Large- Scale Additive\nThere are several approaches to 3D printing at large scales, but they all involve either building bigger machines- such as the BAAM and EBAM systems- or mounting an industrial robot on a rail or gantry and equipping it with additive capabilities, as is often the case for WAAM.\nWAAM\nWire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) uses an electric arc as the heat source and wire- rather than powder- as feedstock. Peter Gratschmayr, senior sales engineer at Midwest Engineered Systems (MES), explained what distinguishes WAAM from other additive systems:\n\"This really doesn\u0027t compete with other laser additive manufacturing technologies,\" he said, \"because those are meant for a higher definition, smaller component. It ends up costing somewhere between 12 and 25 dollars an ounce for the powder to be able to make the part, because there\u0027s usually a 20 percent scrap rate that comes out of it, so not all the powder gets used.\"\nWAAM certainly qualifies as large scale; according to Gratschmayr, MES can make parts up to 42 m x 6 m x 2 m. It\u0027s also useful for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations, since it allows you to rebuild worn- out features on a damaged component by depositing new metal directly onto its surface.\nOne of the biggest advantages of WAAM is that it\u0027s based on a manufacturing technology that\u0027s been around for centuries: welding. In fact, WAAM hardware generally consists of standard, off- the- self welding equipment, including the power source, torches and wire feeding system. This makes it an appealing option for those who aren\u0027t ready to invest in a standalone metal 3D printer, particularly if they already have experience with welding.\n\"WAAM is a different technology compared to other large- formats when it comes to materials (polymers vs. metals) and form (powder vs. wire),\" said Vincent Wegener, managing director at RAMLAB, an additive manufacturing company focusing on WAAM in the marine market. \"What [large- format 3D printers] have in common is the need to deposit a lot of kilograms per hour to be economically viable and most parts require post processing, in the form of grinding or milling, because you\u0027re always depositing near net shape.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/16652/WAAM-BAAM-Thank-You-AM.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"WAAM,

Weighing only 35 kg, the electric bike demonstrates new design techniques only possible with 3D printing, resulting in an overall 30 percent reduction in weight.\nWith the success of the Light Rider motorcycle, APWorks has decided to further its collaboration with its software partner on the project, Altair. Through a nonexclusive partnership between the Airbus subsidiary and the engineering software company, APWorks and Altair will offer joint consulting around metal 3D printing, transfer knowledge around the technology to customers, and advance Altair\u0027s software as it relates to 3D printing.\nAltair and APWorks will work with companies to discover methods for implementing 3D printing at various levels. Services will include finding potential 3D printing applications within a business, redesigning components for additive manufacturing, fabrication and testing of items from the prototype stage up through serial production, as well as determining how products may be improved with 3D printing, cost analysis and building business cases for the use of 3D printing. Once the partners have performed these initial services, Altair and APWorks will transfer knowledge to customers to enable the use of 3D printing.\nAt the same time, Altair\u0027s software will be improved for metal 3D printing applications, ultimately allowing for a complete simulation- driven design process for metal parts. Such simulation will be increasingly necessary as the technology is adopted by mainstream manufacturers accustomed to designing for traditional production techniques.\nPietro Cervellera, managing director at Altair Engineering, spoke to the benefits that the partnership would bring his company\u0027s software. \"I am very happy about this agreement,\" Cervellera said. \"At Altair we have always believed that the place for simulation and optimization is right at the concept phase of the development process. A simulation- driven design process can help designers and engineers generate better design ideas faster and inject innovation into products. APWorks has fully embraced this philosophy as demonstrated by the Light Rider. The bionic frame of this new motorbike APWorks developed has been inspired by nature, generated with OptiStruct\u0027s topology optimization technology, and then printed.\"\n\"This partnership will help us to support our customers even better,\" Joachim Zettler, managing director of Airbus APWorks GmbH, added. \"Our know- how in additive manufacturing and Altair\u0027s expertise in simulation- driven design are a perfect combination to help customers truly benefit from the advantages of additive manufacturing. In our Light Rider project, topology optimization and the advances in additive layer manufacturing have allowed us to realize the bionic design we had in mind for the motorcycle, without having to make any major changes. This led to the revolutionary and lightweight design we envisioned for this project.\"\nThe partnership signals several developments occurring within 3D printing and mainstream manufacturing. Improved simulation software will be necessary to designing for additive manufacturing, as it will enable engineers to understand the performance improvements possible with 3D printing, ushering in a new era of topologically optimized, biologically inspired objects. Through consulting from Airbus\u0027 3D printing subsidiary, manufacturers already well acquainted with the defense leader will be more likely to use the technology in the future.\nWhile it may seem like a small bit of news, this new consultancy could play an essential role in pushing 3D printing into the mainstream manufacturing supply chain, while also allowing Airbus to act as a gatekeeper to the technology.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/12437/Airbus-APWorks-Partners-with-Altair-to-Advance-Metal-3D-Printing-Adoption.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Airbus APWorks Partners with Altair to Advance Metal 3D Printing Adoption","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"medical industry","x":-2170.744873046875,"y":1474.9080810546875,"id":"111","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"7","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"29","initial_node_score":"3.612312209792435","real_tf_idf":"2.789","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":20.0},{"label":"3d bioprinting","x":2226.0791015625,"y":4940.375,"id":"1024","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"616","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"22","initial_node_score":"7.170883342158049","real_tf_idf":"3.247","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_3D Printing is One of the Most Important Economic Topics","x":-1687.8231201171875,"y":4613.85986328125,"id":"1123","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"80","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"According to a recent study, two out of ten German companies with more than 100 employees is already using 3D printing and another 23 % are planning to do so. Germany\u0027s leading industries, i.e. automotive, mechanical engineering and chemicals, are pioneers in 3D printing.\nBuzzwords like Blockchain, Cloud Computing, AI and 3D printing are on everyone\u0027s lips. This is hardly surprising, because in a globalized economy, Germany as a high- tech location must not miss the opportunities provided by potentially disruptive technologies. A recent study by the market research company Bitkom and the IT consulting firm TCS dealt with these topics and questioned German businesses.\nDiscover our New Research Study\nIn cooperation with MISSION ADDITIVE and MM MaschinenMarkt SPOTLIGHTMETAL conducted a market research on the current state of industrial 3D Printing.\nDownload Whitepaper!\nThe representative study concludes that 3D printing is one of the most important topics in the German economy. According to the study 19 % of all German companies with more than 100 employees, has already started to use additive manufacturing. In comparison, only 5 % use blockchain technologies and 11 % use artificial intelligence. Other trend technologies such as big data (44 %) and cloud computing (78 %) are much more widespread in Germany. Since AM is not yet as easy to implement as cloud computing, for instance, due to the relatively high investment costs and the required know- how, there is still some catching up to be done.\nLeading Industries Are Also Leading in 3D Printing\nIt is no secret that German industry is significantly dominated by some industries. Especially the automobile industry is a reliable indicator of the state of the country\u0027s economy. According to the Bitkom study, the automotive industry is also a pioneer in 3D printing, with 41 % (22 % in 2017) of companies already using it. Currently, car manufacturers are using additive technologies mainly for prototype and tool making. Trials of additive series production are conducted more frequently. Above all, the steadily advancing maturity of 3D metal printing has a positive impetus on the suitability for series production of additive processes such as laser sintering and metal binder jetting.\n38 % of machine and plant manufacturers are already using 3D printing. In 2017, only 26 % of the companies used this technology. This increase can partly be explained by the possibility of optimizing the functionality of additively manufactured components, such as optimized cooling structures. In addition, it is now possible to produce tool steel and even industrial diamonds by means of additive manufacturing. In general, more and more manufacturers are qualifying their printers and processes for industrial applications. Its technological progress also increases the profitability of AM and thus its acceptance.\nIn the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, 38 % of companies also make use of additive manufacturing - twice as many as in 2017 (19 %). This technology creates many new possibilities. For instance, drugs could be produced as needed and dosages could be individualized to a high degree.\nMethodology: For this survey 953 companies with 100 or more employees in Germany were interviewed. The interviews were conducted with executives who are responsible for digitalization in their company. The survey is representative for the overall German economy with companies of more than 100 employees.\nAdditive Manufacturing is a Complex Matter\nSince we regularly report on new market studies on the subject of 3D printing, we have noticed that these studies have come to different conclusions. Taking only the German market in 2019 into consideration, several studies have come to different conclusions about the utilization of AM. A representative Bitkom study (555 surveyed companies) from June 2019 suggests that 32 % of German industrial companies already use 3D printing technology - the current study (953 surveyed companies) puts this figure at just under 19 %. A sign that the 3D industry is still difficult to grasp and changing rapidly. New processes, new applications, new manufacturers - the industry is currently booming, becoming more diverse and complex. And who defines what it means to use 3D printing? Is the single use for a prototype enough or does AM have to be permanently integrated into the production? In addition, probably not every user knows whether additive technology was used for an externally sourced component or tool.\nIn order to get an overview of the current application possibilities of AM, we made the reality check. In one of the largest market research studies on the subject in the DACH region, we surveyed industrial users across all sectors on the use of additive manufacturing.\nOur New Research Study: What is it About?\n560 participants from the B2B sector, 80 % of them decision- makers, enable us not only to make qualitative statements, but also to answer the following quantitative questions:\nWhere does additive manufacturing really stand these days?\nWhat can additive manufacturing do and where can it already be used to create value?\nDownload Whitepaper!\nOriginal by Stefan Guggenberger /

3D Printing Trends 2019","x":-4215.5068359375,"y":3878.79833984375,"id":"1114","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"71","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"The 3D Printing Trends 2019, an industry report by 3D Hubs - a Dutch company specializing in online manufacturing - summarized the insights gained by analysing its own transactional database, an independent survey of 400 professional 3D printing users, and a systematic review of the news and recent market analyst reports. The goal was to answers a simple question: why does the industry care about 3D printing today?\nThe most significant change seen in 2018 was the evolution of our perception of the technology. 3D printing isn\u0027t just for prototyping anymore. It is now considered as a valid method of manufacturing end use parts and products. In this article, we will delve deeper into three interesting findings of the report.\n3D Printing is Moving Towards Manufacturing\nThe future of 3D printing was never meant to be in the living room but on the factory floor. The aerospace and medical industries have already embraced the technology for high- end applications, mainly taking advantage of its ability to create lightweight structures with an organic shape.\nUntil recently, however, the high cost of industrial 3D printing compared to other manufacturing technologies was - especially for metal and larger volume - was a prohibitive factor for wider industrial adoption.\nToday, it is the automotive industry that leads the development of 3D printing toward full- scale production. In fact, three out of every four major automotive companies in the US \u0026 Germany (including BMW, Ford, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Mercedez- Benz and General Motors) are now using 3D printing to mass- manufacture parts for their cars or for spare part production.\nThis is a tipping point: the production requirements in this industry are an order of magnitude higher than in aerospace and medical. Industry experts attribute lack of awareness of the full capabilities of the technology as the main barrier to entry today.\nThe Market is Due to Double in Size Every 3 Years\nBy averaging the estimates of different market analysts, the annual revenue of the global 3D printing market is estimated at approximately $10.2 billion in 2018. This figure includes sales of 3D printing hardware, software, and materials, as well as 3D printing and other services.\nFrom 2013 to 2017, 3D printing grew at an average rate of 24.7% every year. For the next five years, the annual market growth forecasted by analysts varies between 18.2% and 27.2%, with the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) averaging at 23.5%. This means that the market is due to double in size every three years.\nMeanwhile, investment in 3D printing is rapidly growing and is focused on industrial solutions and applications. From 2016 to 2017, venture capital funding increased by 86%. In 2018, VC funding exceeded $300 million in startups related to 3D printing.\nDespite its rapid growth, 3D printing still represents less than 0.1% of global manufacturing, which is currently valued at $12.7 trillion. If 3D printing manages to capture just 1% of that market - a scenario that is possible according to many industry experts - then it can reach annual revenues of $125 billion. This is five times greater than even the most optimistic 5- year forecast.\nWhere will this growth come from? Until recently, 3D printing was used almost exclusively for prototyping. However, the prototyping market is relatively small and estimated in the scale of $10\u0027s of billions. Today, large enterprises are making their first steps towards small- scale production and mass manufacturing with 3D printing. The size of these markets is 10 to 100 times larger than prototyping, opening up new opportunities for growth.\n3D Printing is Only Part of the Answer\nOf course, 3D printing will never fully replace all kinds of manufacturing. The technology has many limitations that only now are we starting to understand fully. In fact, only 38% of engineering professional will choose 3D printing for manufacturing and 90% of them would not consider it for production of more than 100 parts. Meanwhile, 3D printing is their first choice for prototyping more than 91% of the time.\nAs a result, engineers turn to technologies such as injection molding and vacuum casting for plastics, and CNC machining, sheet metal and casting for metal production.\nThis is why we should see 3D printing as a piece in the greater digital manufacturing puzzle. It will work synergistically with other digital manufacturing technologies, like CNC machining and low- run injection molding. These \"traditional\" manufacturing are also moving to the online realm, enabling engineers to manufacture parts quickly using processes and materials they are already familiar with.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://industrytoday.com/online-3d-printing-trends-2019/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Online 3D Printing Trends

Today, we\u0027re re- evaluating demand to see how it is evolving. Looking at 4- year hiring trends, it\u0027s evident that demand for candidates with 3D printing and additive manufacturing skills continues to rise. The number of job ads requiring workers with these skills increased 1,834% in 4 years and 103% when comparing August 2014 to August 2013.\n3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing 4- Year Hiring Trends\nSOURCE: WANTED Analytics\n3D printing and additive manufacturing skills were most sought after in engineering jobs, representing 35% of these ads posted over the past 30 days. Other occupational categories that also required candidates with this skill set were IT and management. Below are the jobs that most commonly advertised for 3D printing and additive manufacturing skills.\nMost In- Demand 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Jobs\nIndustrial Engineers\nMechanical Engineers\nSoftware Developers, Applications\nCommercial and Industrial Designers\nMarketing Managers\nIt\u0027s interesting to see marketing along with designers, tech, and engineering jobs. Most positions require candidates to work with and create the technology, but Marketing Managers don\u0027t exactly fit into that mold. However, employers are looking for Marketing Managers to promote their company\u0027s services in 3D printing, communicate their features and benefits to their audience and market, manage partnerships, or research opportunities in this area.\nSome think the future of 3D printing and additive manufacturing is in the manufacturing sector. As this technology improves, it can \"make it easier and cheaper to produce specialized parts on short demand,\" according to Chicago Tribune . This assessment is reflected in hiring trends. Manufacturing had the highest number of job listings for 3D printing and additive manufacturing skills. Specifically, the following industries had the most demand:\nOther Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing\nColleges, Universities, and Professional Schools\nTire and Tube Merchant Wholesalers\nSearch, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing\nAluminum Sheet, Plate, and Foil Manufacturing\nWhile demand has grown, recruiting conditions worsened. Last July, 3D printing and additive manufacturing scored a 44 on our Hiring Scale. Since then, the score increased 16 points to 60. Our Hiring Scale determines likely recruiting difficulty on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 indicating hardest- to- recruit. While conditions on average are likely to be challenging, there are some locations employers can look to source or relocate talent from that may have less hiring difficulty. Below are the locations with the lowest Hiring Scale scores and will likely present the best overall conditions for employers.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/8431/Wanted-Analytics-Demand-For-3D-Printing-Skills-Soars.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Wanted Analytics: Demand For 3D Printing Skills Soars","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"Art:_Recognizing a 3D Printing master","x":-2522.246337890625,"y":3032.203857421875,"id":"1091","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"48","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Additive manufacturing, 3D Printing, rapid prototyping. Whatever your preferred terminology is, it\u0027s a revolutionary industry that has significant impact on product design, development, manufacturing, distribution and service. The industry has proliferated over its 30- plus year history as the materials and hardware have improved significantly, and the cost of ownership have come down. What was once reserved strictly for developing prototypes, is now a legitimate manufacturing process for end- use parts. Even NASA is using 3D Printing in mission- critical components in human spaceflight.\nI began thinking about how far the industry has come after my colleague and business partner Rey Chu received a lifetime industry award for his contributions to 3D Printing and its community of users. The award, known as a Distinguished INnovator Operator (DINO) award, is selected by the Additive Manufacturing User Group (AMUG), a user- driven organization that has been a foundation for the industry since the beginning. Rey joined a select group of only 149 DINO recipients selected in AMUG\u0027s 30- year history.\nYou know you have been doing something for a while when you win an award called the DINO. Rey has been a critical contributor in every step of 3D Printing technology\u0027s evolution. The well- deserved honor bestowed upon Rey is an explicit recognition of his mastery of this significant innovation. He has been involved in 3D Printing for 30 years, nearly the entire lifespan of the industry itself, and has probably forgotten more about it than most of us will ever know.\nIn 1988, Rey, like myself and our other business partner at PADT, Ward Rand, worked at AlliedSignal Engines, now Honeywell Aerospace, at a time when 3D Printing was first being deployed. Rey had the foresight to see the immense impact that this technology could have in aerospace manufacturing, and was able to introduce it to AlliedSignal by initiating the Rapid Prototyping Lab. This became one of the very first labs of its kind in the entire state.\nIn 1994, Rey, along with myself and Ward, decided that we could apply many of the engineering tools and skills we used at AlliedSignal to a much wider audience than just those dealing with turbomachinery, so we started our own company, PADT. Rey especially felt that 3D Printing technology, which was really only used in aerospace at this time, would be a huge asset to any company manufacturing physical products, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.\nShortly after co- founding PADT, Rey led us to purchase a 3D Systems SLA250 Stereolithography machine. With this investment, PADT became the first independent Rapid Prototyping service provider in Arizona. Rey helped to introduce the technology to more product manufacturers and business owners in our state than anyone else because of how broad of a target audience we were reaching. He would go on to spread ideas about the possibilities and applications of 3D Printing to many companies in Arizona that excel in the technology today.\nRey hit another milestone in 1996 when PADT was selected by Stratasys, the largest 3D Printing OEM in the world, to become a reseller of its 3D prototyping equipment. Rey proved his expertise to Stratasys and was able to introduce the top of the line technology to our clients and community partners, further pushing the industry forward in Arizona.\nToday, Rey is the lynchpin of PADT\u0027s reputation as one of the most well- respected 3D Printing service providers in the industry. He and his manufacturing team have worked hand- in- hand with new technology providers, serving as beta testers and early adopters of FDM, SLS, PolyJet and now DLS technology. His research with these materials, as well as new hardware, is referenced throughout the 3D Printing community. He also led the effort to develop a PADT proprietary product, our SCA (Support Cleaning Apparatus), managing design and production for this equipment that dissolves away all of the support material from 3D Printed parts.\nIn addition to his work at PADT, Rey has been a significant contributor to the local community\u0027s growth. Because of his early work in 3D Printing innovation and efforts to push for AlliedSignal and PADT to become early 3D Printing providers, Rey has contributed heavily to Arizona\u0027s abundance of resources. Today, the state is well- known as a nationwide leader for having the top companies, experts and resources in 3D Printing.\nOne of Rey\u0027s most significant contributions to Arizona has been through his work with Arizona State University (ASU), Honeywell Aerospace, GE Additive, Intel and Stratasys, to open the ASU Additive Manufacturing Center, the largest additive manufacturing lab in the American Southwest. The center is home to $2 million in state- of- the- art additive manufacturing equipment and is designed to develop the next generation of manufacturing engineers.\nAs Rey enters his fourth decade in the industry, he spends his time traveling the world evaluating new technologies and bringing innovative 3D printed parts to his customers and user communities. He has been a pioneer in 3D Printing throughout every step of its evolution and continues to be to this day. Rey is indeed the master of his craft and deserving of this lifetime achievement award.\nAbout the Author\nEric Miller is a principal at PADT Inc.

is sizzling. According to Forbes, growth rates are projected anywhere from 18% to 34% annually by 2020. The allure of 3D printing (also called additive manufacturing) is that machines are able to work directly from a computer model, thus designers can devise completely new concepts on the fly without regard for existing manufacturing limitations.\nGiants such as GE and UPS are pouring investment into the sector; buying or investing in additive manufacturing firms to augment their businesses and gain early footing in this evolving technology. UPS is hoping 3D printing centers can shorten its supply chain and cut into its $58 billion- per- year transportation business, giving it a leg up in an emerging market for local production and delivery. Take a look at the video below that was released as part of UPS\u0027 3D Printing Week this month, to see how one electronics designer is using it:\nWhile the titans of industry are taking the lead, 3D printing has also made a significant impact in the mid- market sector as well. Curt G. Joa, located in Sheboygan Falls, WI, is a manufacturer of machinery for disposable paper products. It is also a long- time member of the group buying organization, Prime Advantage. Tony Smith, purchasing manager for Curt Joa, has been singing the praises of additive manufacturing and how it\u0027s given his company a competitive edge ever since it first started using the technology through a third party service three years ago. \"You email a file, the prototype is built from a drawing, and then it\u0027s shipped to you,\" said Smith. \"There might be a little light manufacturing if needed and then it\u0027s ready to use.\"\nThe benefits have been vast as this newfound tool has allowed Curt Joa to create custom replacement parts on demand, increase machine production speed and minimize assembly time. It has also decreased Curt Joa\u0027s lead time as well as lowered warehousing costs courtesy of not having to store racks of replacement parts. Additive manufacturing keeps the door open to using any of the traditional materials you\u0027re accustomed to in the modeling phase, be it plastic, nylon, sand, or metal.\nThe technology initially gained its popularity in manufacturing in the prototype stage. Castings and tooling can be quite expensive when creating various models before production. However, the fluidity and adaptability of 3D printing relieves these costs for manufacturers. So the beauty is, the more complex the part, the more you save. Additive manufacturing had been most commonly used to make certain niche items, such as medical implants, as well as to produce plastic prototypes for engineers and designers. But them times, they are a changing. More and more manufacturers are extending their 3D printing use into production so that its benefits can be realized throughout the entire product development process.\nSo if your company has not yet embraced additive manufacturing, your potential might just be falling short of reaching the next dimension.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.ebnonline.com/manufacturing-straps-on-its-3d-glasses/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Manufacturing Straps on

As 3D printing continues its exponential growth trajectory, what will be its future impact on industrial manufacturing?\nASME.org caught up with David Reis, CEO of Stratasys, one of the key players in the 3D printing market, at a media event held in New York recently. Reis spoke about the rapid growth of 3D printing and how it enables cost and time savings in manufacturing including industries like industrial, aerospace, automotive, medical devices, and consumer products.\nApproximately 80% of fused deposition modeling (FDM) system owners in the U.S. are using the technology in augmented manufacturing for jigs, fixtures, and end- use parts application, said Reis in his presentation. Using 3D printing, \"organizations can realize 40- 90% reductions in lead times and 70- 90% cost savings,\" he added.\nListen to the complete interview in the podcast: 3D Printing Advances to Industrial Manufacturing or read an abridged version below.\nQ1: 3D printing has been used for prototyping inmanufacturing for almost three decades. Which other areas of industrialmanufacturing is it being used in now?\nReis: The last 30 years since the industry has established, our main focus was rapid prototyping, both for design and functional testing. In the last few years, we have been rapidly penetrating manufacturing in two areas. One of them is in the production of end- use parts, which is basically replacing traditional manufacturing processes, such as injection molding and machining with additive manufacturing. The other space we are penetrating is what we call augmented manufacturing, which is basically the manufacturing of tools that aid the manufacturing process. It could be guides, jigs, and fixtures, which assist people on the manufacturing floor to manufacture products.\nQ2: 3D printing has the potentialto disrupt several industries. Is there any application that you think still needs attention and could benefit from additive technology?\nReis: I think there is a great opportunity in the medical space. Already today, there are some companies around the world, which are printing replacement parts for \"body\" like knees, hips. There are great opportunities, and nevertheless, it will require a lot of research and proof- of- concept in clinical validation of this area.\nQ3: There someconcerns about the environmental impact of 3D printed products. What\u0027s your opinion on that?\nReis: I think the nature of additive manufacturing is that it\u0027s more friendly to the environment than the traditional manufacturing processes. Most of the traditional manufacturing processes are subtractive, which means you take bulk of plastic and you subtract plastic from it to get the end part. In additive, you are building bottom up, so you are using only the plastic that you need. So by definition, you are using less plastic and the process will be consuming less energy.\nQ4: With so many products now being developedusing 3D printing, are standards required?\nReis: The use of additive manufacturing to manufacture products is relatively small but rapidly growing. Most of the use of additive manufacturing today is in rapid prototyping and augmented manufacturing. The production of end- use parts in each industry will require compliance with current standards. A good example could be aerospace. If you want to replace a flying part in the airplane, you have to comply with standards in aerospace. Likewise in medical.\nQ5: What is the future outlook for 3D printing and do you think3D printers will someday becomeas common as themicrowave in homes?\nReis: The outlook is great and the projection is that this industry is going to grow dramatically over the coming decade. The numbers are talking of growth from $3- 3.5 billion in 2014 to $20 billion in 2020, which is only seven years from now. Whether I think 3D printing will become a household tool for manufacturing parts at home, I am a little bit more pessimistic about it. I think it will take more than a few years to get there, but we might be able to see it 20- 30 years from now.\nMost of the use of additive manufacturing today is in rapid prototyping and augmented manufacturing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/5-questions-stratasys-ceo-david-reis","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"5 Questions with Stratasys CEO David Reis","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"forecast 3d","x":-5629.19091796875,"y":-1013.640380859375,"id":"877","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"172","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"18","initial_node_score":"7.65730542037636","real_tf_idf":"4.095","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_Better printing through collaboration","x":-5692.216796875,"y":2387.16162109375,"id":"1048","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"5","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"PTC and Stratasys have announced the companies are working together to make additive manufacturing more accessible to designers and manufacturers.

Independent research conducted by Savanta, an international research firm, details a comprehensive view of the current and future potential for 3D printing in 12 countries worldwide, while covering the widest range of verticals and professions, including education. The quantified index reveals the USA, UK, and Germany have the highest expectations for implementing additive manufacturing and capitalizing on its opportunities.\nThe index is a measure of market awareness and adoption; adoption levels over time; as well as overall sentiment towards the potential impact of the technology. It is based on 2,548 interviews with qualified professionals and in- depth analysis of macro- economic factors. Five key elements were investigated: market awareness, adoption and install base, 3D printing growth indicators, perceived future impact and optimism, and technology infrastructure and ease of adoption. Overall, 67 percent of respondents are currently aware of the terms \u00273D printing\u0027 and \u0027additive manufacturing\u0027. However, only 35 percent have adopted the technology. Two thirds - 65 percent - think that 3D printing will revolutionize their industry and nearly 40 percent say that 3D printing will bring significant operational efficiencies and cost savings to their businesses over the coming 12 months, indicating the market\u0027s rapid evolution.\nConfidence in 3D printing\u0027s advantages in the USA\nA large majority of USA- based survey respondents (87 percent) believe that 3D printing offers extensive benefits in bringing new concepts and design to life. This belief is underscored by how Americans use 3D printing - 77 percent of respondents use 3D printing to produce prototypes. The design flexibility that 3D printing offers is unmatched by traditional sourcing methods and allows for increased customization and efficiency in the design process.\nMarket awareness of 3D printing or additive manufacturing\nThe survey shows that the Netherlands (83%), Switzerland (82%), and the USA (77%) have the highest levels of awareness. The Netherlands, home to several 3D printing companies, is often considered a leader in technology. Switzerland has strong growth in both the manufacturing and research field - industries where 3D printing has a high innovation and adoption rate.\nLevel of adoption of 3D printing technology\nBy investigating the number of businesses that have adopted 3D printing and used the technology for more than 5 years, the survey determines the current maturity level across various countries. In China, 53 percent of businesses have adopted 3D printing and 11 percent have used it for more than five years, followed by the USA (34 percent adoption and 19 percent have 5+ years of usage) and France (42 percent adoption and 8 percent have 5+ years of usage). This is significantly higher than the global average.\nCurrent 3D printing budget and plan to increase investment in the future\nWhen the 67 percent of respondents who are aware of the technology were asked about their current and future 3D printing budgets, China, India, and the Netherlands came top with the highest current budget and future investment plans over the next 12 months. Wang Peng, Secretary- General of the Additive Manufacturing Alliance of China shared with The Telegraph that: \"3D printing is entering a golden period in China. After years of development, it has turned from an innovative concept to something quite helpful in upgrading manufacturing plants.\" With current install bases being low in India and Netherlands, an increase in investment is inevitable driven by the positive sentiments.\n\"Sentiments are the start of a domino effect,\" says Rohit Jhamb, Director Global Research \u0026 Analytics at Ultimaker. \"Positive sentiments lead to positive behaviour and investments, resulting in a future of significant and sustainable growth. This research is the widest and most in- depth in terms of coverage that combines end customer voice with macro- economic indicators. It offers a complete view of the current ecosystem and future growth potential for 3D printing and shows that we have moved past the hype often associated with 3D printing. For potential stakeholders who haven\u0027t embraced the additive manufacturing market and are hesitant about entering, this Index shows they should be unafraid to contribute and can expect a healthy return on that contribution.\"\n\"Being close to end- customers is something we always highly value,\" says Jos Burger, CEO at Ultimaker. \"These findings confirm our current strategy for delivering easy- to- use, reliable solutions that anyone can leverage to gain a fast ROI with 3D printing. In that sense, Ultimaker is uniquely positioned, since we provide the market with an open ecosystem of hardware, software and materials. By delivering a complete solution that seamlessly integrates with existing workflows, we are on track to facilitate this positive future growth potential and continue to be the driving force to achieve true digital distribution and local manufacturing.\"\nMethodology\nSavanta Group, independent market research consultancy, conducted this research on behalf of Ultimaker between August 1st to September 30th, 2019 across three key regions - Europe, APAC, and North America. In total, 2,548 skilled professionals across a range of key verticals and professions, received the survey of which 1,632 completed the survey. The study was administered online and fielded in 12 different countries in 8 languages. The respondents are working full time or part time and were between 18 and 64 years old. The survey targeted professionals working in education, automotive and aerospace, manufacturing, architecture and construction, consumer goods, healthcare and medical technology, entertainment and the creative industry. Respondents are invited to take part via email and are provided with loyalty points as part of Savanta\u0027s scheme for qualified members who take part in multiple surveys.

PrinterPrezz- a company focused on the creation of advanced medical devices using metal 3D printing, nano and semiconductor technologies- aims to take the industry to a new level with the assistance of Greg Morris, a pioneer in additive manufacturing (AM). He was recently named to the company\u0027s advisory board.\n\"We\u0027re thrilled to have Greg join our board of advisors to help PrinterPrezz revolutionize the medical 3D printing industry,\" said Shri Shetty, PrinterPrezz CEO. \"We\u0027re at an inflection point, where additive manufacturing has the potential to transform modern medicine and surgery, creating new options and improved clinical outcomes for doctors and patients. Greg\u0027s experience in the application of transformative technologies and deep roots in 3D printing, including medical applications, will be invaluable to the continued expansion and growth of PrinterPrezz.\"\nMorris, along with two partners, established Morris Technologies in 1994. It evolved into a leading provider of AM services. The company, which was purchased by GE Aviation in 2012 and later formed into GE Additive, introduced the first additive metal sintering 3D printer to North America. He and his company worked to drive the use of these technologies in an array of industries including aerospace and automotive.\n\"Medical is the next frontier for additive manufacturing,\" Morris said. \"Like the aerospace and automotive industries before, the medical landscape is the next logical step for additive to make a profound- life- changing, in fact- difference for both healthcare providers and patients. PrinterPrezz is at the intersection of manufacturing and medical, and I\u0027m excited to contribute to a company that\u0027s focused on making a difference.\"\nMorris stayed on with GE, including as an ambassador for 3D printing and as part of a team promoting the use of additive metal for gas turbine engine parts design and production metal, before retiring in 2018. He was recognized for his contributions to metal AM and 3D printing as an inductee to the TCT Hall of Fame.\nInterested in learning more about how 3D printing is revolutionizing the medical industry?

That means holiday cheer and a spate of articles, columns, and blogs predicting trends that will shape manufacturing in 2019.\nA good trends piece about additive manufacturing was posted recently on the website of the Belgian software company Materialise. (The firm has a U.S. office in Plymouth, Mich.)\nTitled \"Polymers, Productivity, and Policy: 3D Printing Trends in 2019,\" the blog predicts the following for next year:\n1. Applications, not technology, will drive the 3D printing industry forward. According to Materialise, the industry will continue shifting its focus to identifying the right applications for 3D printing rather than developing new technologies. Investments will not go to \"machine manufacturers anymore but to companies and start- ups that apply 3D printing to create real added value in specific domains.\"\n2. A rise in polymer materials for 3D printing. \"Last year, we predicted that metal 3D printing would get its deserved attention in 2018. This time around, it\u0027s the plastic materials for 3D printing that have been preparing for substantial growth in 2019. Major material manufacturers are playing a big role in this movement.\"\n3. Software will be the key to boosting productivity in 3D printing. \"3D printing started three decades ago as a rapid- prototyping technology, evolved into a customization technology, and now is being adopted for serial manufacturing. As industries work on integrating 3D printing into their production mix, their challenges are less about technology and more about economics. The goal is to reduce costs and to increase efficiency.\"\n4. Technology- neutral interconnectivity, not proprietary solutions. \"For 3D printing to ... claim a bigger share of the $12 trillion [global manufacturing market], the 3D printing industry needs to offer interoperability and technology- neutral solutions. If industrial manufacturers want to be serious about adopting 3D printing as a complementary manufacturing technology for final products, they simply cannot afford to be locked into proprietary solutions that limit their flexibility and choice.\"\n5. Governments will get more involved. \"We have seen 3D printing emerge as a discussion point in governmental environments,\" said a Materialise spokesperson, \"and we believe this will increase significantly in 2019. This rise is a signal that 3D printing is gaining importance in society and is freeing itself from the label of a prototyping technology.\"\nHappy holidays. And here\u0027s hoping that your life-both personally and professionally-trends upward throughout 2019.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.thefabricator.com/additivereport/blog/additive/software-company-materialise-identifies-five-3d-printing-trends-for-2019","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Software company Materialise identifies five 3D printing trends for 2019","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"keynote presentation","x":-4873.93115234375,"y":-4073.383544921875,"id":"479","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"13","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"47","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"5","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"11","initial_node_score":"0.34923260752111673","real_tf_idf":"1.136","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(80,115,206)","size":20.0},{"label":"metal fabrication","x":2233.306396484375,"y":-1727.84130859375,"id":"791","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"97","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"18","initial_node_score":"1.5801544454880059","real_tf_idf":"1.97","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":20.0},{"label":"manufacturing solution","x":-2059.1181640625,"y":-3320.5478515625,"id":"759","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"4","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"91","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"4","top_kp":"3","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"4","num_appearance":"151","initial_node_score":"3.88530327193439","real_tf_idf":"10.744","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,174,208)","size":30.0},{"label":"method","x":4913.236328125,"y":4041.02490234375,"id":"927","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"253","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"40","initial_node_score":"1.41304718417814","real_tf_idf":"3.759","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_Integrating Functional Elements into 3D Printing","x":2865.789794921875,"y":3637.3212890625,"id":"1113","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"70","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Image Credit: belekekin/Shutterstock.com\n3D (three- dimensional) printing techniques have been in development since 1974, when pioneering British chemist and author David E. H. Jones proposed a concept for 3D printing in his regular New Scientist column, \"Ariadne\". There, Jones fantasized about laser- based polymerization techniques with which \"any type of solid object at all could be made up: even complex interlocking and re- entrant shapes quite impossible to mold\".\nPerhaps inspired by the potential applications in research and development, engineering, manufacturing, and a plethora of other fields more so than by Jones\u0027s lighthearted article, researchers in academia and industry have spent recent decades realizing what was mere fantasy 40 years ago.\nAdditive Manufacturing\nModern 3D printing is also known as additive manufacturing and includes a wide variety of techniques. In all of them, components, devices, and so on are \"printed\" layer by layer from the desired material or materials. These layers are printed using various material depositors, guided along x and y axes by computer- assisted design (CAD) software. The z height axis profile is given by the successive build- up of layers over one another.\nThe benefits of additive manufacturing are wide- ranging. Multiple design iterations can be tried out in relatively cheap materials to test compatibility with existing systems, measure mechanical properties, and visualize dimensions more easily. Further, unlike classic subtractive manufacturing, 3D printing techniques do not waste excessive material by cutting it out, profiling it, and grading it.\nFunctional Elements\nAdditive manufacturing is no longer only suited to simple mechanical or structural elements and components made of single materials, and its uses are extending far beyond the research and development phase of the manufacturing process.\nNow, the complex interlocking and re- entrant shapes that Jones fantasized about are possible. As well as this, multi- material 3D printers have been developed, as well as advanced lithographic techniques.\nThese developments have resulted in additive manufacturing\u0027s increasing ability to create numerous advanced and functional elements, and further progress in this area can be expected. Below are a few of the functional elements that 3D printing can create.\nSuper Titanium Tailpipe\nKoenigsegg, the Swedish supercar manufacturer, produced One:1 supercar in 2014. Research and development for this superfast vehicle was heavily reliant on the rapid prototyping design process made possible by 3D printing, but the final product itself also featured 3D- printed functional elements. The tailpipe printed entirely in one piece of titanium was the largest 3D- printed titanium object at the time, taking three days of continual printing to produce.\nTotally Personalized Human Body Implants\n3D printing saw some of its first non- research applications in medicine. It can be used to create totally personalized implants that match patients\u0027 unique individual bodies. These functional elements of the human body - and additions to it - represent a growth area for additive manufacturing, especially with aging populations around the world requiring hearing aids and dental implants to be produced at a much higher rate in future years.\nAutomated Circuit Board Assembly\nIn computing manufacture, 3D printing can be used to remove the need for lengthy and tedious processes of imaging, drilling, plating, solder mask coating, nomenclature printing, and surface finishing to produce circuit boards. All of these steps must be completed in meticulous detail, allowing for not inconsiderable margins of error in the process.\nAdditive manufacturing could replace these steps by starting from a final product in the CAD software, and building up to it in the required materials to make a single- component circuit board effectively.\nClick here to have a look at different types of 3D printers\nFuture Integration of Functional Elements into 3D Printing\nIn the future, advances in additive manufacturing techniques will allow for a greater range of materials, scales of size, and complexities of design to be completed with a 3D printer. These advances could enable numerous functional elements to be produced, such as batteries, nanotechnology, engine parts, and more.\nThis future revolution in additive manufacturing is now the source of another scientific fantasy topic - one which could very well become a reality in decades to come. Advanced 3D printing would enable computers to rapidly prototype and test iterations of robots, machines, medicines and so on, enabling an automated system of work and support for the planet\u0027s inhabitants.\nA world in which robots can produce and repair robots automatically while continually developing their functionality could lead to technological utopia, and it may not be as unrealistic as it sounds. Jones\u0027s readers in 1974 may have dismissed his laser- guided 3D polymerization \"bath\" as the fantasy of a lighthearted columnist, but we have already surpassed his vision.\nReferences and Further Reading\nEllam, R.

launch of 3D Metal Printing magazine. With its first issue slated for spring 2016, 3D Metal Printing will target designers, engineers, executives and others working in the aerospace, automotive, tooling, medical and other industries where applications for metal additive manufacturing promise to rapidly expand.\n\"The pace of change in this industry is unbelievably rapid,\" says Andrew Flando, publisher of 3D Metal Printing and vice president of publishing and expositions at PMA. \"Manufacturers continue to find ways to use 3D metal printing to create complex parts in a way that increases efficiency and allows them to quickly deliver new products to market.\"\n\"The use of additive- manufacturing services grew by 40 percent in 2014,\" adds Alan Meckler, chairman and CEO of MecklerMedia, quoting recent industry surveys. MecklerMedia produces the Inside 3D Printing tradeshow and conference- the largest professional 3D printing and additive manufacturing event worldwide.\n\"We know that the use of 3D metal printing to manufacture end- use parts will increase dramatically during the next three years,\" continues Meckler. \"That\u0027s why we\u0027re excited to partner with PMA to launch this new publication.\"\nMeckler\u0027s point is reinforced by a new market survey released by Stratasys, finding that by 2018 additive manufacturing of end- use parts is predicted to increase by 38 percent.\n\"Metals are the fastest- growing segment of 3D printing,\" adds Flando, \"with printer sales growing by 48 percent and material sales growing by 32 percent in 2014. And, the adoption of 3D metal printing is expected to nearly double by 2018.\n\"This new publication will be a critical resource,\" continues Flando, \"to help designers, engineers and others working in manufacturing stay up to date on the latest 3D metal- printing technology.\"\nThe Precision Metalforming Association (PMA) is a trade association representing the $113- billion metalforming industry of North America which creates precision metal products using stamping, fabricating, spinning, slide forming and roll forming technologies, and other value- added processes. Its nearly 900 member companies also include suppliers of equipment, materials and services to the industry.

Until recently, only a handful of industries used additive manufacturing but that\u0027s all about to change. 3D printing is currently one of the hottest and most interesting advancements in technology and has the potential to revolutionise all sorts of industries from automotive and aerospace to electronics and healthcare.\nOne of the key advantages of 3D printing is that it makes it possible to create a product from scratch in just a few hours. Designers and developers simply create their product onscreen and the 3D printer will produce an accurate, physical part. It saves time, minimises costs and has dramatically increased the flexibility of design processes in all industries.\n3D printing is not a new concept to the automotive industry. Car manufacturers have long been using additive manufacturing to print out prototypes for manufacture; however more recently companies have started to actually print the physical parts too.\nBack in 2012, Grainger \u0026 Worrall a specialist automotive parts manufacturer invested half a million pounds in 3D printing technology. This was in anticipation of orders of small quantities of vehicles parts for luxury car brands such as Aston Martin, Bugatti and McLaren. Using 3D printing allows automotive manufacturers to bypass very long lead manufacturing processes (such as tooling) and achieve direct manufacture.\nAdditive manufacturing is also enabling massive transformations in efficiency in production processes within the aerospace sector. Aircraft manufacturers see the potential of additive manufacturing and have invested billions of pounds into the technology and development of metal powders used to make everything from turbine blades and structural parts to jet engine parts such as combustion nozzles.\nIn the past many aircraft parts needed many individual components, but thanks to 3D printing they can now be printed in one. This was illustrated by GE, which recently printed a fuel injection nozzle in one piece that was previously comprised of twenty different components. Not only did they simplify the manufacturing process by using 3D printing but they also managed to make the fuel injection nozzle five times stronger.\nAnother industry that is at the forefront of additive manufacturing is the electronics industry. The size, shape and materials used to make electronics products make this industry a natural candidate from 3D printing. By creating electronics products with 3D printing, companies are able to save a significant amount of time, money and waste during the manufacturing process.\nWhilst 3D printing is currently being used to make a handful of electronics such as antennas and batteries, the process of creating semiconductors has been a little trickier. However a team of researchers at Princeton has recently found a solution for 3D printing semiconductors, which involve using printable electrodes, polymers and semiconductors that are dissolved in solvents.\nIit\u0027s not just the automotive, electronic and aerospace industries that are benefiting from 3D printing. Industries you may not have even thought about associating with additive manufacturing like the health care sector have also found the technology to be particularly beneficial.\n3D printing is currently being used to create medical devices, save theatre time and costs and improve patient care. In this sector, they have had the most success with 3D printing prosthetics and medical devices like hearing aims, which can be made from plastic or pliable materials. The key benefit of 3D printing these devices is that it makes every item completely customisable, allowing patients to benefit from a perfect fit.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/3d-printing/spi-lasers-explores-the-3d-printing-revolution","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"SPI

dedicated applications for industrial 3D printing, Additive Industries is organising this Design Challenge. Competing in two categories, both professionals and students are encouraged to redesign an existing conventional part of a machine or product for 3D printing.\nA professional jury will evaluate all designs submitted and assess whether they contain the distinctive features and freedom additive manufacturing has to offer. The partners of the Design for Additive Manufacturing Challenge are Ultimaker, a consumer 3D printer manufacturer, Altair Engineering, leading CAE technology provider, Autodesk, a leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment software and CECIMO, European Association of the Machine Tool Industries, who are also a part of the competent jury.\nThe finalists will take home wonderful prizes like software licenses and the Winners receive besides a 3D printed Award also the latest Ultimaker printer. All six finalists will be invited to Additive World Conference on March 20th, 2019 in Eindhoven, where the winners of the Design Challenge 2018 will be announced during the Additive World Awards Dinner.\n\"We are looking forward to this 5th anniversary edition of the Challenge, with inspiring (re)designs to eliminate manufacturing difficulties, reduce the number of parts, minimize assembly or lower logistics costs\" adds Daan A.J. Kersten, co- founder and CEO of Additive Industries.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://additivemanufacturingtoday.com/additive-industries-launches-5th-edition-of-design-challenge","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Additive

Redesign Your Additive Production Process","x":1491.5888671875,"y":-320.0320739746094,"id":"1110","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"67","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"For many years, additive manufacturing has been thought of as a prototyping technology. Many believe that a 3D printed part is useful for a model or a fit check, but when you actually want to manufacture a part, you have to go to other techniques, such as molding or machining.\nWith today\u0027s 3D modeling, scanning, and printing technology, that isn\u0027t necessarily the case.\nOne of the challenges facing additive technology is finding applications that take full advantage of its capabilities, without getting mired in its shortfalls. For example, you can\u0027t just unplug a CNC milling machine and plug in a SLS metal printer. The materials, operation time, and surface finish just can\u0027t compete. However, by optimizing an entire production process for additive from start to finish, the technology can deliver real results.\nAt 3D Systems, an American manufacturer of 3D printers and software, the additive manufacturing production process is thought of holistically, in an end- to- end manufacturing system, from design software to full scale printing to inspection software.\nThe Additive Production Process\nIn the design phase, engineers are used to a certain set of conventions for designing parts, such as draft angles for plastics or inside radii for machining. With additive, few of these conventions exist. It can be difficult to design freely for a completely new set of constraints. New software specifically designed for additive may help sidestep some of these design thinking challenges. 3D Systems produces a scan- based design software to scan a part and create a fixture or an additional part in the assembly. Another option is a simulation software to optimize the part for additive manufacturing, such as orientation, supports, and build envelope nesting.\nNext, the part is sent to a 3D printer for production either in metal or plastic material. Today, a large range of plastic materials are available, from highly rigid to high temperature resistance plastics. According to 3D Systems, the range of materials rivals that of injection molding. On the metals side, 3D Systems has an open system, allowing users to research and test their own metals and develop a custom material as needed for the 3D Systems machines.\nThese first two stages, from the design and modeling into printing a tangible part, are where one of the key strengths of additive manufacturing shines: iterative design. With additive manufacturing, the low cost and low lead time of prototypes allows engineers to iterate, improving the design incrementally before finalizing the production part design.\n\"We utilize a lot of analysis software to apply pressures and forces to our models and they can be changes any way. We can build in any geometry, any orientation you can imagine, produce it overnight, test it, and move forward,\" said Chris Schneider, applications engineer at 3D Systems.\nThose used to subtractive machining are used to certain ways of thinking: primary axis, turning, etc. Additive disrupts those conventions, as parts are buildable in different orientations, with different structures, new materials and more. Schnieder\u0027s best piece of advice for those looking to get started with additive: \"Just try something. The sky\u0027s the limit. We can probably do anything that you can think of, so bring something you think you probably can\u0027t do, and then go one step further.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/16260/Video-Redesign-Your-Additive-Production-Process.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Video: Redesign Your Additive Production Process","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"construction","x":2582.368896484375,"y":4285.77880859375,"id":"862","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"152","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"47","initial_node_score":"1.3171692285686731","real_tf_idf":"6.88","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"strategic partnership","x":-3080.014892578125,"y":-3376.1875,"id":"874","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"168","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"44","initial_node_score":"3.7890054213348776","real_tf_idf":"3.814","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"3d printing industry","x":-2642.260498046875,"y":2109.818359375,"id":"19","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"5","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"4","num_appearance":"242","initial_node_score":"19.837576864287257","real_tf_idf":"16.647","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"3","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":35.0},{"label":"supply chain","x":-4918.43017578125,"y":-383.17901611328125,"id":"51","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"4","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"4","num_appearance":"117","initial_node_score":"6.971380443312228","real_tf_idf":"11.335","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"3","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":30.0},{"label":"Art:_Materialise and Additive Industries Partner for Industrial 3D Printing Applications","x":-5349.40869140625,"y":-2272.0263671875,"id":"1060","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"17","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Materialise NV, a provider of additive manufacturing software and 3D printing solutions in the medical and industrial markets, has entered into a development partnership with Additive Industries, a Dutch company specializing in metal additive manufacturing equipment for industrial applications.\nMaterialise is building partnerships with machine manufacturers to bridge the gap between 3D software and a range of 3D printers.

Class":"0","top_articles":"10","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"As more companies embark on their digital transformation, they are increasingly reevaluating their manufacturing processes. For one, they\u0027re exploring how 3D printing can enhance and augment traditional manufacturing methods.\nAdditive manufacturing is a powerful force within digital manufacturing, bringing new applications and markets into focus. In the future, the additive manufacturing market is predicted to reach $55.8 billion by 2027. What\u0027s more, year- over- year growth rates for 3D printing are surpassing 20 percent.\nThat continued growth is reflected in the findings of a new survey conducted by Jabil on \"The Current State of Additive Materials and 3D Printing.\" The company surveyed more than 300 manufacturing decision- makers around their use of additive manufacturing and the results indicate explosive growth expected for 3D printing, compared to the 2017 survey.\nThe upward trajectory of the popularity and applications of additive manufacturing point to growing opportunity, particularly when it comes to materials. Although 3D printing potential and capabilities are at an all- time high, many companies are still struggling to procure necessary materials - whether because the price is too high or the materials are not certified for 3D printing.\nNevertheless, indications are that 3D printing utilization will continue to grow and manufacturing stakeholders are very excited about the plethora of opportunities it offers. Following are some of the key findings from the survey:\n1. Growth Rates for 3D Printing Have Skyrocketed\nExpected growth rates for the use of 3D printing have skyrocketed since 2017. Most additive manufacturing stakeholders (96%) do predict that their company\u0027s use of 3D printing will grow over the next few years. The majority expect this growth to be significant, including 39% that report that it will increase at least five times and 47% that think it will at least double.\nDrilling down further, larger companies are much more likely to predict that 3D printing will increase dramatically. Almost all (91%) of stakeholders from a large company predicted that their company\u0027s use of 3D printing will at least double, and over half (52%) stated that it will increase dramatically (five times or more).\n2. The Impact of 3D Printing is Expanding\nAccording to respondents to our survey, the impact of 3D printing on the overall manufacturing industry is up notably. In fact, almost all manufacturing stakeholders (97%) report that it will transform the way they think and operate. Most remarkably, for almost two- thirds (59%), this impact has already happened. The remaining 38% believe it will come and is only a matter of time.\n3. Most 3D Printing Use Cases Are Up Dramatically\nUse of 3D printing is up significantly across nearly all use cases in the 2019 survey compared to 2017, including production parts; bridge production; repair; and jigs, fixtures and tooling, with the most dramatic increases seen in production parts (up 25% since 2017) and repair (up 24%). Only one option - prototyping - decreased in popularity (66% from 69%), which is perhaps inevitable given how much usage has increased in every other category.\n4. 3D Printing for Functional or End- Use Parts is Growing Significantly\nUsing 3D printing to produce functional or end- use parts is an application that has grown significantly over the last year, from 80% in fall 2017 to 96% in the beginning of 2019. About two- thirds of companies use 3D printing to make at least 10% of these parts.\nOne possible concern in using 3D printing to create these parts could be that they won\u0027t have the strength such a vital component requires, but as we can deduce from the fact that usage of 3D printing has already risen significantly in this area, it seems likely that as manufacturers become more accustomed to utilizing 3D printers for this task, they will use them more for functional or end- use parts.\n5. Materials Challenges Represent Opportunity\nSome of the most dramatic innovation in recent years has been the evolution in the materials available for 3D printing. Researchers, designers and engineers are using a wide variety of materials: human tissue, pizza dough, even lunar dust. The ability to work with metals, ceramics, and composites in addition to plastic opens a world of\npotential. This represents an opportunity for materials around lower costs, better parts quality, and a broader selection of materials, given that survey respondents cited these types of materials- related challenges as some of the most difficult for them to overcome, (47%, 40%, and 37% respectively).\nA Bright Future for 3D Printing\nThe future of additive manufacturing looks bright with 3D printing continuing to position itself more prominently in the manufacturing landscape. And as costs continue to reduce and processes become increasingly more efficient, the possibilities for use- cases will expand considerably.\nJohn Dulchinos is Vice President, Digital Manufacturing at Jabil, Inc. where he is responsible for leading the company\u0027s digital manufacturing strategy including robotics, 3D printing, M2M communications and automation.

It is one of the industries where additive manufacturing\u0027s twin advantages of complex part design freedom and personalisation can really be utilised. The medical industry is also the industry where some of the more cutting edge and groundbreaking uses for additive manufacturing are taking place and being researched.\nSo where is 3D printing being used today;\nHearing aids, this is a perfect case study for 3D printing where the desire for personalisation meets the low volume required for each particular item. Additive manufacturing is perfect for creating the organic shapes specific to each user which then house the stock electronic assembly.\nOne of the applications of additive manufacturing within medical which is already having a big impact is the ability to practice before procedure. Surgeons can use data taken from MRI and CT scans to build 3D models of the patient\u0027s anatomy they will operate on. They then use this 3D CAD data to manufacture 3D printed models, enabling them to practice tricky surgery techniques on realistic models to perfect technique. This allows surgeons to be more precise, reduce risks and operate faster, all things which are good news for the patient.\nThe dental industry is also one of the biggest users of 3D printing. Again using scans taken from the actual patient\u0027s mouth dentists and dental laboratories are able to build accurate and tailored solutions to fix dental problems. Use cases include 3D printed aligners which slowly move the teeth into a desired position as well as 3D printed crowns and bridges. Additive manufacturing is a massive and growing player in the dental industry and there are already a number of machines and materials built specifically for this market.\nPatient specific implants PSIs, these can be very expensive and time consuming to make using traditional manufacturing techniques but with additive manufacturing can be done quickly and precisely in massively reduced time lines. Especially for complex organic shapes which traditional manufacturing techniques struggle with 3D printing really holds its own. Two of the major advantages of 3D printing for these applications are the ability to use patient specific data to build the implants and the ability to create matrix or lattice patterns on the surface of the parts. These patterns aid osseointegration and reduce rejection.\n3D printed surgical cutting and drill guides are a growing application within the medical sector, especially in dental. Like drill jigs for manufacturing which ensure holes are in the right place, surgeons often use jigs to ensure their operations are in the precise location. These have on the whole been off the shelf parts but using 3D printing it is now possible to have bespoke guides built to the patient\u0027s unique anatomy. Meaning more precise operations and better postoperative results.\nProsthetics are some of the more famous case studies in 3D printing for medical applications. There have been numerous stories of companies manufacturing simple 3D printed prostheses for children or people in developing countries without access to alternatives. This is just the surface though and there are numerous companies working on this in a very serious way. Additive manufacturing offers the ability to make patient specific prostheses without being prohibitively expensive.\nSome of the applications of 3D printing outside of traditional manufacturing include the possibility to 3D print organs. This could be one of the most revolutionary uses of 3D printing and one with real scope to change the world as we know it. If it was possible to print new organs and body parts using your own cells as the base, then millions of people desperate for transplant donors would no longer have to wait for a suitable match.\n3d printed designer drugs. Current drug and medicine production is on a mass scale and the medicines are not targeted but more catch all solutions which work with varying effectiveness and intensity for different people. Additive manufacturing opens up the possibility of printing designer medicines which are specific to you, your body and your needs.\nAdditive manufacturing enables not just personalisation but also, importantly, cost reduction and gains in success. There are sure to emerge many more potential applications. Not just of existing technologies and materials but as new medical specific technologies are designed and developed, 3D printing will continue to change the face of the medical industry.\nAbout James Murphy\nJames Murphy born in the UK has lived and worked in the manufacturing industry in China for the past 12 years. During that time, he has worked with hundreds of companies large and small from many industries to utilize rapid manufacturing and 3D printing to realise their project goals.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtomorrow.com/article/2018/10/additive-manufacturing-in-the-medical-industry/12281/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Additive

also known as additive manufacturing, is al alternative production technology which allows for a layer- by- layer creation of more durable, stronger and lighter objects.\n\"You may have heard about the benefits of 3D printing - the freedom of designs, the lack of tools required, the just- in- time inventory, and so on. To the engineers of today, the list of advantages are endless - it\u0027s a revolution for companies, across all industries,\" explains Joe Hughes, tech expert at Writinity and Last Minute Writing.\nWith all of the benefits of 3D printing, you\u0027d think it would be as commonplace as Wi- Fi in today\u0027s world - but that\u0027s actually not the case. Many companies are struggling to find ways to incorporate 3D technology printing into their product development and manufacturing operations - a bare 2% of the manufacturing market is made up of 3D printing, according to a 2014 report.\nHowever, this is all set to change. The global 3D printing market is set to reach $21 billion by 2020, quadrupling in size. It\u0027s useful then, to understand that despite the challenges faced by businesses wanting to use 3D printing, there are many benefits to 3D printing - the freedom to design what they want, easy prototyping, customisation and streamlined logistics. The challenges presented by 3D printing should be understood by manufacturing leaders, in order to overcome them.\nLack of Standardization\nOne of the main problems of 3D printing is the lack of standardization of machines, and the potential for low- quality products. Sometimes, the inexpensive nature of 3D printing costs quality; there are high- end machines that cost millions of dollars to purchase, but others product goods that are inferior to those made by traditional manufacturing.\nThere is a lack of universal standards in the printing technologies - many manufacturers worry about their products or parts of products produced via 3D printing will be on a par with other manufacturing methods in terms of quality, strength and reliability. So, they remain wary of 3D printing technology, judging the risks involved too great to meet with the benefits.\nLately, there are pushes to end this uncertainty with industry wide standardization of Additive Manufacturing.\nExpenses\nTraditional manufacturing has become a refined and incredibly efficient process over the years. Think about plastic bottles - we\u0027re simply too good at making them, so much so that they are a huge issue for the environment. 3D printing may simply be too expensive for a few more years to come, as processes are not refined and streamlined enough.\nFor example, metal printers required by big companies can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars - the process is slow, and costly. The time taken to 3D print depends on the number of layers that need to be printed, and the speed of the printer itself. Even the best 3D printers can only build between 5 and 40 cm per hour.\nProduct Lifespan Problems\nThe possibility to print a lot of spare parts on demand can extend product guarantees and is actually much more environmentally friendly. Unfortunately, many companies rely on a business model based on low quality products and product rotation. By reducing product obsolescence, 3D printing is a problem - companies will have to work on new business models that guarantee quality and product lifespans, and don\u0027t rely on manufacturing new products constantly. Moreover, 3D printing allows customers to print their own spare parts - not a good thing for companies!\nCopy- Cats\nAs noted above, consumers could begin printing their own product parts. This is made even more problematic when we see that smaller businesses could begin printing product parts and whole products, copying the intellectual property of bigger businesses.\n\"Cheap knock- offs from abroad have already seen companies face big hits, and if consumers and small businesses can now product home- made copies, distribute designs and copy products, manufacturers could see their sales hit hard. The manufacturing industry will need to adapt - and that could mean selling dematerialised files with a license online,\" notes Sophia Austin, a business journalist at Draftbeyond and Researchpapersuk.\nAshley Halsey is a professional writer at LuckyAssignments and Gumessays.com who has been involved in many projects throughout the country, including many studies of automation and additive manufacturing.

The immersive course is created to help engineers and designers develop practical methods and strategies to get the most from different 3D printing technologies.\nThe invitation- only course titled Designing for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) takes place over 3 days near Raleigh, NC, concluding at Protolabs\u0027 77,000- sq.- ft. 3D printing facility. Leading the discussion are Olaf Diegel, associate consultant at Wohlers Associates, along with Terry Wohlers, principal consultant and president at the company. Diegel also serves as head of the Creative Design and Additive Manufacturing Lab at the University of Auckland. Joining Wohlers and Diegel are AM engineers from Protolabs, with expertise in both polymer and metal 3D printing technologies.\n\"Designing for AM offers unique challenges and opportunities not found in traditional design methods,\" says Wohlers. \"Protolabs brings tremendous depth of expertise and leadership in 3D printing. We\u0027re thrilled to work together to equip attendees with technical skills and manufacturing knowledge needed to unlock the full potential of additive manufacturing.\"\nThe course aligns with Protolabs\u0027 larger goal of advancing industrial 3D printing in manufacturing, the company says. Last year the company joined GE Additive\u0027s Manufacturing Partner Network and later became a founding member of MIT\u0027s Center for Additive and Digital Advanced Production Technologies (ADAPT)- a consortium focused on scaling new manufacturing technology through research, education, actionable insights and an MIT- based ecosystem that pairs industry and academia.\n\"Additive manufacturing has moved well beyond this worn- out notion that it has to prove its worth- we\u0027ve seen firsthand its maturation over the years and have literally 3D printed millions of parts during that time,\" says Protolabs\u0027 president and CEO, Vicki Holt. \"We know it\u0027s an extremely valuable prototyping tool but it has now made significant strides in materials and technology where production is its logical next phase. Collaborating with the world\u0027s leading additive experts- and those who look to leverage that technology to its fullest- will serve to proliferate the education and adoption of 3D printing.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/protolabs-and-wohlers-associates-team-up-for-immersive-course-on-design-for-additive-manufacturing","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Protolabs and Wohlers Associates Team Up for Immersive Course on Design for Additive Manufacturing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"complex geometry","x":4522.9658203125,"y":3525.419189453125,"id":"436","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"42","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"49","initial_node_score":"1.0111897508613765","real_tf_idf":"3.917","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"rocket engine","x":6068.96533203125,"y":-2111.156494140625,"id":"544","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"14","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"57","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"36","initial_node_score":"8.444696725346148","real_tf_idf":"5.437","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(192,79,112)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_Interview Corona Crisis - Boost or Brake for AM-Technologies?","x":1863.4691162109375,"y":-4976.783203125,"id":"1138","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"96","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"The foundry industry is suffering from the decline in production in the automotive industry and the resulting lower demand for metal components. Does this development affect additive manufacturing processes? Tina Johnscher answers this question in an interview.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: The foundry industry is complaining about interrupted supply chains but also about a lack of demand due to the decline in production - especially in the automotive industry. Does this problem also affect the trend in additive manufacturing?\nTina Johnscher: The current crisis situation is rather a driver for additive manufacturing. By using this technology, even smaller quantities can be produced economically - either directly or through additive manufactured tools - which ideally take up lightweight design aspects and thus simplify the retooling of casting systems.\nHowever, it must be taken into account that companies are usually not as willing to invest in an economic crisis. This could slow down the spread of additive manufacturing as companies would first have to invest in equipment such as printers and materials and the development of know- how.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: Do you believe that additive manufacturing, in view of interrupted supply chains and lack of demand, will increasingly complement or even replace conventional manufacturing processes such as casting in production? What role do costs play here?\nTina Johnscher: Additive manufacturing will not replace conventional manufacturing processes in the foreseeable future because it is not suitable for these cases. However, gaps in the supply chain can be closed by additive manufacturing, at least when it comes to spare parts and machine parts. The cost of spare parts also plays a negligible role here, since the downtime of large- scale plants causes significantly higher costs. However, the investment costs for the procurement of industrial additive manufacturing equipment are high - but the advantage of being able to react more quickly to changing demand could compensate for this after a short time.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: The production lines of the automotive industry in Europe are almost at a standstill. As a result, demand for cast components is declining sharply. What opportunities could foundries use to move into other markets by using 3D printing?\nTina Johnscher: Additive manufacturing - used in prototype construction - accelerates product development enormously. Innovation cycles can be shortened, making it easier to enter new markets. The direct production of final components via additive manufacturing could of course also serve markets that require more individually adapted parts or small series, such as the (special) mechanical engineering, aviation or even shipping industries. However, it takes a lot of time and work to build up the necessary know- how and to earn the customers\u0027 trust. Companies also have the possibility to enter markets which are similar to the automotive industry, e. g. markets for agricultural and construction machinery.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: According to current reports, the Volkswagen Group wants to produce health masks using 3D printing. In times of the corona crisis - to what extent could additive manufacturing give companies new opportunities with regard to market gaps, innovation and materials? Do the circumstances provide an opportunity for companies to enter new markets?\nTina Johnscher: When companies look at the possibilities of additive manufacturing, it also increases the creativity of product developers and designers, and opens their eyes to new products and markets. Crisis situations are always a driver for innovation, since it is especially economic pressure that makes the necessity of constant innovation clear. The pressure to deal with new potential markets, materials and products will have a lasting effect on many industries. The current global crisis highlights the dependence of many industries and companies on international trade. Additive manufacturing can be of great benefit to companies in this regard: it enables them to close supply bottlenecks and react flexibly to volatile requirements. However, in order to use additive manufacturing successfully, flexible adaptation and rapid response to emerging needs are necessary. This must also be reflected in the company management.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: An advantage of additive manufacturing is the flexibility regaring shape and material usage as well as the fast manufacturing process. Is additive manufacturing superior to conventional processes in times of crisis?\nTina Johnscher: This cannot be generalized. If a product is manufactured in large quantities, other processes are certainly superior to additive manufacturing. Respiratory masks and other medical accessories are currently manufactured using 3D printing due to the fact that local supply bottlenecks have to be overcome. This is where the strengths of additive manufacturing become apparent: The corresponding equipment can be used quickly and without expensive conversions and is often available at many locations. The advantage of flexibility in conversion and batch size can of course also be applied to other products.\nHowever, the production speed in additive manufacturing depends strongly on the component size and the required post- processing effort. Additive- manufactured metal parts - like many castings - must be heat- treated, whereby surface treatment usually has to be included in the calculation, as the surface roughness is often very high. This is another reason why additive manufacturing is currently not used for large series.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: So what is your conclusion on additive manufacturing in the context of the corona crisis? Do you have action recommendations for foundries?\nTina Johnscher: Basically, I recommend that companies do not invest in promising technologies thoughtlessly, but rather consider what the technology is to be used for and which markets or new products the company wants to enter before making a purchase. Since there are many different additive processes and suppliers, companies should also consider the matter in depth before making investments.\nSPOTLIGHTMETAL: Thank you for the interview, Ms. Johnscher!\nThe Additive Manufacturing Coordination Center\nThe Additive Manufacturing Coordination Center, which is affiliated with Bayern Innovativ GmbH, acts as a hub that networks all the key players and newcomers to 3D printing and links activities related to this future- oriented subject. The Coordination Office wants to make it easier for small and medium- sized companies in particular to get started in additive manufacturing.\nVisit the

coming of age, and with its progression, it is a space to watch closely in the year ahead.\nFREMONT, CA: Additive manufacturing or 3D printing molds the way one builds objects opening up a sea of new capabilities. By gradually adding layers of materials, instead of cutting and soldering, 3D printing facilitates firms to make parts with new geometries. New- fangled compositions have different physical properties. The instance is where 3D printing becomes a powerful tool for industrial applications where one can now build parts that are lighter, stronger, more heat resistant, and requiring fewer parts. The complexity comes free with additive manufacturing- one can create a geometrically complex object as effortlessly as a simple one.\nHowever, in 2020, the most exhilarating new expansions will possibly come from the evolution of 3D printing technology. Manufacturers of 3D printers are working hard to develop the performance of their equipment along different dimensions:\n3D Printers Will Get Faster: For additive manufacturing to achieve a grander scale 3D Printers require to produce much larger volumes, and to do so, they need to print faster. One firm has already been pushing its limits of speed, with a thermal inkjet technology, which leverages the speed properties of 2D printing. The business also unveiled a new machine intended to be ten times faster than conventional 3D printing processes. The race is on, and so one can expect more speed records to be broken this year.\n3D Printers Will Inhabit an Extensive Range of Environments: Additive manufacturing can be a delicate process. In most 3D printers, it takes place inside a chamber, which controls humidity and temperature and keeps out superfluous particles. The occurrence can considerably limit what the machines can do. One manufacturing firm has developed tools that can print in uncontrolled settings: they can operate on oil rigs, in the field, and army forward operating bases. Free of the constraints of a limited chamber, they can print more significant parts and be used to repair along with building new pieces. In 2020, businesses can anticipate seeing 3D printers to operate in an extensive range of remote environment.\nSee Also :- Top 3D Printing Startups","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtechnologyinsights.com/news/here-s-what-2020-holds-for-3d-printing-nwid-1482.html","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Here\u0027s What 2020 Holds for 3D Printing","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"computer model","x":1016.769287109375,"y":4152.6044921875,"id":"585","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"63","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"1","top_kp":"5","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"1","num_appearance":"5","initial_node_score":"0.39728615432977676","real_tf_idf":"0.587","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":15.0},{"label":"Art:_Additive Manufacturing Conference 2018 Registration Now Open","x":-2711.506103515625,"y":-7038.2236328125,"id":"1124","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"81","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Registration is now open for the (AMC 2018), scheduled for September 11- 12, 2018. This year\u0027s conference is returning to North America\u0027s largest manufacturing event, the International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) at the McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois.\nPresented by Gardner Business Media\u0027s Additive Manufacturing Magazine and Modern Machine Shop, the Additive Manufacturing Conference is a two- day technical conference, exhibit hall and business networking event focused on the industrial applications of additive technologies for making functional components and end- use production parts.\nThe 5th annual conference falls on the heels of the inaugural 3D Printing Workshop at NPE2018, making Additive Manufacturing Media the only brand with events at the nation\u0027s largest manufacturing and materials tradeshows.\n\"This technology\u0027s biggest potential lies in the hands of manufacturers, those that can innovate ways to evolve part production through those technologies,\" said Dave Necessary, Event Director. \"That\u0027s why we\u0027ve committed to bringing programming to places like IMTS that allow us to demonstrate how far the technology has integrated into production, and to show how much farther it can go.\"\nWith a program curated by the editors of Additive Manufacturing Magazine, the conference focuses on industrial applications of 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies for making functional components and end- use production parts. Presenters and exhibitors include HP, UL, Jesse Garant Metrology, Desktop Metal, Hybrid Manufacturing and more.\nThe AMC program includes technical sessions examining design, material, machinery and applications technology used in additive manufacturing. Specific topics include hybrid CNC machines (combining additive and subtractive manufacturing), large scale 3d printing, multi- jet fusion, light weighting, safety, advanced materials, and much more. Technical presenters include thought leaders from OEMs, leading additive manufacturing job shops, machinery suppliers and cutting- edge research outfits.\n\"We are committed to industrial applications of additive manufacturing,\" said Dave Necessary, Event Director. \"The Additive Manufacturing Conference is the only 3D printing event that focuses exclusively on end- use part production. Being at IMTS lets us showcase how revolutionary this technology is for manufacturing and bring it directly to those who have already adopted AM and those that are significantly invested in adding it in the near future.\"\nAdditive Manufacturing Conference registration includes:\nComplete access to all Additive Manufacturing Conference technical sessions\nA pass to the IMTS 2018 exhibit hall - featuring more than 2,400 exhibitors, including the Additive Manufacturing Pavilion\nProfessional networking during meals, breaks and the reception\nConference Proceedings\nRegistration is open for Additive Manufacturing Conference 2018, and includes access to the IMTS show floor.

(AM) innovations in fused granulate fabrication (FGF). The company is partnering with Juggerbot 3D, an additive manufacturing machine builder who recently developed a printer equipped with extrusion technology, to explore the untapped potential of FGF printing. Together, the two companies will develop high- performance pellet printers and materials for industrial additive manufacturing.\nDSM and JuggerBot 3D are exploring the untapped potential of FGF printing to develop solutions that meet a need among manufacturers. JuggerBot 3D\u0027s newest printer is designed specifically to process performance materials, like DSM\u0027s glass- reinforced Arnite AM8527 (G). The company also leveraged DSM\u0027s expertise during the development of its new P3- 44 printer. The P3- 44 has a build volume of 3 feet deep, 4 feet wide and 4 feet tall, and is capable of producing parts up to 200 times faster than other machines.\nDSM is one of the first partners to purchase JuggerBot 3D\u0027s P3- 44 printer. Set to further scale up additive manufacturing to industrial workflows, DSM will continue to add more pellet products to its portfolio of 3D printing solutions.\nRemoving Barriers to Adoption of 3D Printing\nAfter collaborating on a fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printer, the two companies are now working together to leverage technology, top- tier materials and the sharpest minds in the 3D printing industry to revolutionize FGF additive manufacturing. Using the P3- 44 and DSM material formulations, the two have established a development program for companies interested in FGF printing.\n\"The need for pellet materials and printers that are able to produce large- scale applications is evident,\" says Hugo da Silva, VP Additive Manufacturing. \"Working side by side with innovative printer manufacturers like JuggerBot 3D allows us to create material solutions while ensuring manufacturers have access to reliable machines. Materials or printers alone are not sufficient for OEMs to adopt the technology. That is why a smoothly running ecosystem is so critical for additive manufacturing to be accepted on the production floor.\"\n\"We\u0027re addressing the largest barriers to the adoption of 3D printing with fused granulate fabrication,\" Dan Fernback, Co- Founder at JuggerBot 3D,\" says. \"The P3- 44 is truly a reliable, industrial- grade machine that allows users to tap into a plethora of production materials and scale their additive manufacturing efforts.\"","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/royal-dsm-partners-with-juggerbot-3d-an-am-machine-builder","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Royal

starting to see the beginning of high- volume additive manufacturing. Part of this transition involves finding the right manufacturing applications for 3D printing technology, as well as tackling the additive learning curve.\nUltimately, however, making the transition comes down to research- professional engineers and students putting the time in to develop new methods that demonstrate how additive manufacturing can reduce lead times and streamline costs.\nThat\u0027s why Phoenix Analysis and Design Technologies (PADT) has teamed up with Stratasys to unveil a new additive manufacturing lab in Colorado at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. Expected to open later this fall, the Lockheed Martin Additive Manufacturing Laboratory will be dedicated to using 3D printing for the creation of composite tooling applications.\nAt the centerpiece of this lab are additive technology solutions from Stratasys, specifically, the Fortus 900mc Production 3D Printer. The lab is being funded through a grant from Lockheed Martin Space Systems.\n\"Building the Lockheed Martin Additive Manufacturing Laboratory at MSU Denver is a major development in the progression of additive manufacturing tooling applications,\" said Rey Chu, principal and co- founder, manufacturing technologies at PADT.\nInitially deployed at MSU Denver, the additive manufacturing curriculum will later become available for use by other academic institutions across the country. Additionally, PADT will work with MSU Denver, Lockheed Martin and other users to build a Fortus 900mc Users Group within the Rocky Mountain region.\n\"We have no doubt the lab will quickly become a cornerstone of additive manufacturing innovation across the State of Colorado,\" said Tim Schniepp, director of composite solutions at Stratasys.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/15584/Lockheed-Martin-Additive-Manufacturing-Laboratory-Aims-to-Spur-Composite-Tooling-Research.aspx","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"Lockheed Martin Additive Manufacturing Laboratory Aims to Spur Composite Tooling Research","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"digital","x":-4900.7763671875,"y":-3110.661865234375,"id":"164","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"15","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"10","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"3","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"44","initial_node_score":"0.5840375423431396","real_tf_idf":"3.648","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(78,156,0)","size":25.0},{"label":"dubai","x":1628.2861328125,"y":5660.6611328125,"id":"469","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"46","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"19","initial_node_score":"7.728283815551549","real_tf_idf":"3.886","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"2"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"additive manufacturing challenge","x":-699.4514770507812,"y":-5196.3466796875,"id":"285","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"1","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"22","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"14","initial_node_score":"3.816642459947616","real_tf_idf":"2.22","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(255,52,13)","size":20.0},{"label":"ai","x":-3555.935546875,"y":1238.1170654296875,"id":"774","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"8","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"94","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"2","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"17","initial_node_score":"1.4535250132903457","real_tf_idf":"2.696","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(162,128,0)","size":20.0},{"label":"Art:_3D Printing Developments Increase in Size, Complexity","x":2989.03515625,"y":-134.12765502929688,"id":"1078","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"35","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Larger, more diversified, and other expanded capabilities are becoming increasingly commonplace in the additive manufacturing market. Recent 3D printing developments have focused on not only improving the quality of printed materials but also the size of outputs, opening up a whole range of new opportunities for the technology.\nIn 10 years, the 3D printing industry is predicted to be worth $22 billion. Additive manufacturing is moving from simply being a means of rapid prototyping to an economically viable means of mass production. Much of this growth will be driven by the expansion of printing capabilities, in both the size and complexity of finished products.\nMetals at the center of 3D printing developments\n3D printing systems are now able to print metals at competitive prices, with startup Desktop Metals developing a system that costs only $120,000 and is capable of producing metal parts significantly cheaper and faster than traditional machining technologies. Such is the potential of the system that it has propelled the company into rounding up significant fundraising support. Desktop Metal has joined lists of the most influential players in the additive manufacturing world.\nIn another example, 3D Systems is expanding both its hardware and software offerings for metal and plastic additive manufacturing, print materials, and on- demand manufacturing services. In addition, 3D Systems\u0027 extensive partner network helps its broadening range of customers improve their production outcomes. The network makes it easier for companies to integrate 3D printing developments into their production environments.\nAerospace, automotive, and other industries have started using 3D printing rather than machining for parts because the lower cost and faster completion. As additive manufacturing is proven for high- performance parts, more markets will adopt it.\nThis includes printers such as 3D Systems\u0027 ProX DMP 320, the high- precision, high- throughput direct- metal printer optimized for critical applications requiring complex, chemically- pure titanium, stainless steel, or nickel superalloy parts.\nElectronics integration\n3D Systems and Fabrisonic are now among companies that offer additive manufacturing processes that provide embedded electronics in the metal printed part.\nThe key in these 3D printing developments, according to Mark Norfolk, president and CEO of Fabrisonic, is to use a process that heats the metal to no more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit. While that is too cold of a temperature for metal to melt for bonding with other metals, by moving at a fast enough speed to remove oxidation, the additive manufacturing process removes any oxidation, so metals will stick together.\nThe solid- state nature of this bonding process enables the joining of different metals without the brittleness found in the fusion process\nNorfolk added that the company\u0027s ultrasonic additive manufacturing process can be stopped at any time so that channels for wires or other electronic components can be added.\nThis way, the electronic components can be sealed, so they won\u0027t suffer the same degradation that components exposed to the elements suffer. Fabrisonic\u0027s low- temperature process enables the sensors to be embedded into solid metal parts without damage.\nScientists at Harvard University have also added sensing capabilities to soft robots. They have used a system that forgoes traditional sensors in favor of a 3D- printed conductive ink that can communicate touch or contact with the robot\u0027s control system. 3D printing developments in these soft robotic applications could have important uses in manufacturing as well as in medical devices and prosthetics.\nOther soft robotic uses come from the printing of gallium alloys, a flexible yet conductive compound that could open up more electronics printing applications including flexible screens.\nMore on Manufacturing:\nIncreasing size, increasing opportunity\nWhile Fabrisonic is concentrating on the embedding of electronics, other 3D printing developments come from companies and researchers working on developing capabilities to print ever- larger parts.\nFor example, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) had a printed tool in excess of six feet high. The tool had no functional purpose, said Andrzej Nycz, R\u0026D associate, but was instead a demonstration of the growing capability of 3D printing.\nThe U.S. government is exploring other 3D printing developments. The Department of Energy\u0027s (DOE) Manufacturing Demonstration Facility (MDF) recently installed a second large- volume 3D printer. It can print two different materials on one object for materials research by ORNL scientists.\nThe next- generation printer is provided by Cincinnati Inc. which has printed automobiles, a house, a mold of a wind turbine blade, and a trim tool being used to help manufacture the wing for a new passenger jet. In fact, ORNL\u0027s printing of the trim tool for The Boeing Co. resulted in the lab winning the title of the largest solid 3D printed object by Guinness World Records.\nThe new system will be able to 3D- print polymer material in sizes up to 13 feet long, 6.5 feet wide, and 8 feet tall, enabling taller structures than the existing big area additive manufacturing (BAMM) printer\u0027s capacity of 20 feet x 8 feet x 6 feet.\nSome companies are finding that for many applications, they can use plastics rather than metals in the printing process, said David Johnson, 3D printing business development manager for GSC, a consultancy service.\nOne example of this comes from Oak Ridge\u0027s 3D- printed car shown at the recent Fabtech show. This year\u0027s 3D printed car was a Shelby Cobra, featuring ABS carbon fiber resin printed on a Cincinnati BAMM printer over a 12- hour period.\nThe BAAM system extrudes a wide variety of thermoplastics and fiber reinforced thermoplastics to build parts layer by layer. SAAM uses the same process to produce prototypes and smaller parts, saving materials and providing a right- sized solution for additive applications.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/manufacturing/3d-printing-developments-increase-size-complexity/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D Printing Developments Increase in Size, Complexity","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"tct show","x":-4712.11474609375,"y":-62.727779388427734,"id":"991","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"412","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"2","num_appearance":"18","initial_node_score":"2.482735245488584","real_tf_idf":"3.149","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"cad","x":-6469.7109375,"y":1608.0657958984375,"id":"512","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"52","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"2","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"43","initial_node_score":"2.2667491871397942","real_tf_idf":"4.361","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"3d printing model","x":-785.1834716796875,"y":4045.6103515625,"id":"399","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"36","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"1","top_kp":"3","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"1","num_appearance":"6","initial_node_score":"0.4959734855219722","real_tf_idf":"0.789","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":15.0},{"label":"proto","x":-4643.24560546875,"y":-1934.86279296875,"id":"931","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"0","kp_of_top_articles":"255","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"3","top_kp":"1","article":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"3","num_appearance":"21","initial_node_score":"2.9966223407536745","real_tf_idf":"4.855","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"2","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"2","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"1","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"1"},"color":"rgb(0,134,86)","size":25.0},{"label":"Art:_DSM and Briggs Automotive Company Announce Collaboration on New Mono R Supercar","x":-5723.79638671875,"y":-2718.9677734375,"id":"1077","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"34","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Royal DSM, a global science- based company in Nutrition, Health and Sustainable Living today announced a collaboration with Briggs Automotive Company (BAC), the British supercar manufacturing company based in Liverpool. Together, the two companies will co- develop innovative 3D printing applications for the new BAC Mono R and showcase the potential of additive manufacturing in the automotive industry thanks to weight reduction and increased customizability.\nDSM and BAC will work together to unlock the full potential of additive manufacturing in the automotive industry. Both companies are convinced that integrating 3D printing in car manufacturing allows for the creation of parts that are not only lighter, but also stronger and customizable to meet specific customer needs. In addition, 3D printing enables original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to explore new designs that would be impossible to produce using traditional manufacturing methods.\nThe new Mono R features a series of new, 3D- printed parts. For instance, BAC and DSM developed 3D- printed grips for the Mono R\u0027s steering wheel that are fully customizable to its driver. The car also features new 3D- printed air inlets that are lighter, more durable, and more cost- effective to produce than traditional inlets. Thanks in part to design, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), and manufacturing changes to key parts of the Mono via 3D printing, BAC and DSM were able to limit the weight of the new supercar to 560 kilograms - a record low.\nOther innovations are still to follow. For instance, DSM and BAC are currently exploring the design and production of 3D- printed parts incorporating new, organic shapes and hollow internal structures - radically reducing weight while maintaining strength. Additive manufacturing also enables OEMs to replace materials now common in car manufacturing with newer, high- performing and recyclable materials.\nBy using state- of- the- art CAE tools, DSM supports BAC in designing lightweight parts using the full potential of design for additive manufacturing (e.g. allowing design for function, which limits material to places where it is needed to support mechanical loads). Many of DSM\u0027s traditional and high- performing polymers are already commonly used in the automotive sector. By re- engineering these tried and tested materials and optimizing them for 3D printing purposes, DSM Additive Manufacturing is enabling new and innovative designs to surface, as showcased by the record- breaking Mono R.\nIn time, the weight- reducing and durable properties of additive manufacturing will undoubtedly also be integrated into designs for mainstream vehicles.\nPatrick Duis, segment leader Automotive at DSM Additive Manufacturing: \"The BAC Mono is the perfect showcase for the potential of 3D printing to reshape the automotive industry. Additive manufacturing offers unparalleled options for small- series production and customization of cars, and we are excited to work together with BAC to optimize our materials for car manufacturers. This brings us another step closer to Manufacture Tomorrow.\"\nIan Briggs, Design Director of BAC: \"We pride ourselves on being the ultimate pioneers at BAC, and joining forces with DSM means we can once again lead the way - this time in terms of additive manufacturing. Keeping the car as light as possible is of paramount importance, and by using 3D printing we not only keep the kilograms down, but also keep sustainability and safety on the up. We\u0027re excited to see how our work on Mono R can translate to the automotive industry as a whole.\"\nImproving sustainability in car manufacturing\nDSM and BAC will continue collaborating closely to explore new technologies, materials and applications for 3D printing in the automotive industry. Both companies will also look for opportunities to improve sustainability in vehicle and other manufacturing processes. In 2018 BAC became the first car manufacturer to go climate positive, which means it removes more carbon dioxide from earth\u0027s atmosphere than it emits.\nAdding additive manufacturing to the mix will enable BAC to cut its emissions even further, for example because 3D parts can be printed on site rather than having to be shipped across the globe. The company will also have access to DSM\u0027s line- up of recyclable materials, further aiding its sustainability ambitions.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID\u003d51669","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"DSM and Briggs Automotive Company Announce Collaboration on New Mono R Supercar","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_7":"0","num_appearance":"5000","initial_node_score":"0.0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_8":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_6":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_5":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_4":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_7":"0","gobal_initial_node_score_jenks_class_6":"0"},"color":"rgb(4,4,4)","size":10.0},{"label":"Art:_3D Printing Moves into Manufacturing with Gusto","x":-3065.550048828125,"y":-590.539794921875,"id":"1105","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"62","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"At the Rapid TCT show, additive manufacturing systems were on display, and booth- by- booth, we heard the rationale for serial 3D printing production, i.e., manufacturing.\nTrade shows often come with an unstated theme. The second LiveWorx conference in 2015 came with the theme: \"IoT can be deployed from product development through manufacturing and customer use.\" A couple years ago, Siemen\u0027s PLM World users\u0027 conference was all about digital twins. At Advanced Design and Manufacturing in Cleveland last year, presenters and attendees were talking about how small- to mid- size companies were ready for smart manufacturing technology.\nThe unstated theme of last month\u0027s Rapid TCT 3D printing show was that additive manufacturing is ready for prime time. (Image source: Rapid TCT)\nAt the Rapid TCT 3D printing show last month, the unstated theme on the trade show floor was: 3D printing is ready for product manufacturing. Not just small runs, not just custom production, but honest- to- goodness manufacturing across multiple industries. The buzzword on the show floor was \"serial production\"- code for \"manufacturing.\"\nThe concept of economically viable 3D printed manufacturing seemed to be on everyone\u0027s lips. The idea of 3D printing with advanced metals was very yesterday. At Rapid TCT, the news over and over was the mainstreaming of additive manufacturing. Behind all of the acclaim for 3D print- based production was the explanation of the economics that prove additive manufacturing is viable on a wide commercial scale.\nThe Economics of Additive Manufacturing\nWhile nobody I met on the floor was making a case for using additive manufacturing for the mass production of hundreds of thousands of units, the economic case for tens of thousands of units was clear. \"If it costs you $50,000 to produce 5000 parts, it seems like each part costs $10. But when you use the first part, it actually costs you $50,000. When you use the second part, then each part has cost you $25,000,\" John Dulchinos, VP of digital manufacturing at Jabil, told Design News. \"If you no longer need that part and there are 1,000 remaining, then each part ultimately costs you $12.50.\"\nThe idea is that unused inventory is a liability that distorts the real cost of manufacturing. Aside from the expense of unused parts, there\u0027s the balance- sheet cost of parts sitting on shelves. 3D printed parts are radically just- in- time. \"With additive manufacturing, you may pay more for an individual part. But without the problem of leftover inventory or two years\u0027 worth of inventory still on a shelf, additive manufacturing can be less expensive,\" said Dulchinos.\nFirst Aerospace, then the World\nWhile additive manufacturing on a widespread scale is new, the concept has been viable for many years for some industries. \"We\u0027ve been supplying manufactured parts using 3D printing for longer than people realize,\" Scott Sevcik, VP of manufacturing solutions at Stratasys, told Design News. \"We\u0027ve had a 12- year relationship with Boeing. They\u0027re an early adopter of 3D printed parts. For 30 years, this technology has been moving toward manufacturing. Boeing and aerospace in general have recognized the value of highly complex, low- volume manufacturing using 3D printing.\"\nOne of the roadblocks to the manufacturing of 3D printed parts was the quality, reliability, and durability of the printed products. Aerospace accepted additive manufacturing once it was assured that the parts were as strong as machined or molded parts. \"Boeing had confidence in the materials. That\u0027s why they embraced additive manufacturing,\" said Sevcik. \"They knew they could scale large without a negative impact on the materials. And they could control the process in a highly detailed way.\"\nThough it varies with each industry, spare parts can carry heavy costs. They can sit on shelves for years and, ultimately, up to 20 percent of those parts remain once they become obsolete. 3D printing eliminates that cost. \"With aftermarket parts, you gain efficiencies with additive manufacturing. It reduces waste, since you don\u0027t have to produce a part until you need it,\" said Sevcik.\nAnother argument that bolsters the case for additive manufacturing is the ability to print complex assemblies that were previously a composite of multiple parts. \"Efficiency comes with the elegance of 3D printed parts. You can reduce weight, and with the complexity of the parts, you can reduce the number of parts,\" said Sevcik. \"In an Atlas V rocket, they were able to reduce 140 parts to 16 parts by making parts that were more complex.\"\nRapid TCT may have put to rest that long- held idea that 3D printing was great for prototypes and one- off replacement parts, but not for production. Booth- by- booth, I kept hearing the economic case for additive manufacturing or, as they liked to call it, \"serial production.\"\nRob Spiegel has covered automation and control for 17 years, 15 of them for Design News.

use metal for 3D printing","x":2737.25439453125,"y":2706.064208984375,"id":"1115","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"0","top_articles":"72","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"3D printing encompasses a variety of different printing processes and is primarily additive in nature. Each of the technologies is suitable for use with a different range of materials, which in turn defines the suitable applications of the printer. 3D printing may have started with form and fit testing for prototypes, but the technology has evolved in the past few years to encompass manufacturing products on a mass scale.\nWith 3D printing, designs are not constrained by manufacturing limitations, and design complexity no longer adds cost. This opens up design avenues and enables the economic production of lighter components. This aspect is critical to the aerospace and automotive industries.\n3D printing in metal is being used to manufacture parts in a wide variety of industries. Metals are the fastest growing segment of 3D printing, with printer sales growing at 48% and material sales growing at 32%, according to the IDTechEx report titled, \"3D Printing of Metals 2015- 2025.\"\nAdoption by high- value, low- volume industries\nThe IDTechEx report states that high- value, low- volume industries such as aerospace and biomedical have been the earliest adopters of 3D printing in metal because of the current speed. For example, GE Aviation has invested more than $3 billion to house 3D printers to print 100,000 fuel nozzles by 2020. In addition to titanium, the aerospace industry also is investing in cobalt, nickel, and aluminum alloys to be used in additive manufacturing. Arcam, which manufactures electron beam melting (EBM), has used 3D printers to manufacture more than 50,000 orthopedic implants for the medical industry.\nThe report states that both industries have a strong need for titanium alloys and combine for a market share of 31% by volume. In addition to titanium, the aerospace industry also is investing in cobalt, nickel, and aluminum alloys to be used in additive manufacturing.\n3D printing in metal objects also is being used in the dental industry. According to the report, dental supplier Argen Digital is producing metal substructures to make copings and bridges with the same properties as cast parts.\n3D printing in metal is also used for more creative outlets as well as mass production. The report states that the jewelry industry is very invested in 3D printing metal objects. Jewelers were early adaptors of selective laser melting (SLM) technologies, which allow the designer to customize precious metals with relative ease. The jewelry industry is driving 3D printing in precious metals, with gold powder having a 49% market share by revenue.\n3D printing, in some ways, is a natural extension for the jewelry industry because:\nThere are no qualifying standards for jewelry\nJewelry designers are already good at computer- aided design (CAD)\nDesigners are skilled in finishing and polishing and are accustomed to making items\nDesigners crave artistic freedom and unusual designs.\n3D printing\u0027s profile is growing\nLocal Motors put 3D printing in metal in display at IMTS 2014 in Chicago with the demonstration of their 3D printed car. The printing process lasted the entire show, using carbon fiber as the material, and ended with the car driving around at the end of the event. Everything on the car that could be integrated into a single piece such as the exterior and the chassis was printed. While it took several days for everything to come together, the concept alone is an example of where 3D printing is going. The technology is enduring its growing pains as users continue to work out the bugs and any potential faults. It is clear, however, that based on IDTech\u0027s report, many industries see 3D printing in metal as the future, and it will become a mainstay in mass production before people realize it.\n- Chris Vavra, production editor, Control Engineering, CFE Media, cvavra@cfemedia.com.\nONLINE\nLearn more about 3D printing in metal from the IDTechEx report here:\nLearn more about Local Motors\u0027 3D printed car.\nKey concepts:\nAdditive manufacturing is moving past printing prototypes and is now being used for mass production.\n3D printing in metal is the fastest growing segment of 3D printing with the aerospace and medical industries using it for mass production.\nSome industries, like jewelry, are 3D printing in metal for custom projects.\nConsider this\nWhat other industries could use 3D

its potential to transform the way products are designed, developed, manufactured, and distributed, 3D printing is expected to grow into an $8 billion market for the automotive industry by 2024. Many factors are driving the growth of 3D printing or additive manufacturing technology, including ease in the development of customized products, cost- effective manufacturing, government investments in 3D printing projects, and development of new industrial- grade 3D printing materials. The increasing customer demand for innovations, cleaner, lighter, and safer designs, as well as lower prices across customized products, is also encouraging the automotive 3D printing market. In addition to offering benefits such as reduced weight, energy- efficient cars, and reduced CO2 emissions of vehicles, Zimlon assesses the impact 3D printing has on the car insurance market. 3D printing is a game- changer in the spare parts industry with as many as 85% of spare parts suppliers looking at embracing 3D printing. From reduced inventory and logistics costs, with the help of 3D printing, manufacturers can store these spare- parts digitally and produce them on- demand.\nCost Savings- 3D printing can cut costs for prototyping and production. Tucci Hot Rods estimate they save about $500 per part using 3D printing methods instead of using machine- made, aftermarket solutions while car manufacturer Opel reported a tooling cost reduction of 90% for the assembly process.\nFaster Prototyping- Productivity and speed have increased three- fold because 3D printing eliminates the time and effort required to create prototypes and test materials. According to BMW, 3D printed customized tools helped save 58% in overall costs and reduce project time by 92%.\nReduced Wastage- 3D printing uses material only where it\u0027s needed, eliminating wastage by 95%. Avoiding extra costs for wasted material can revamp production processes.\nCustomized Cars- With 3D printing, creating multiple variants of a model can be done without much trouble. In a new service offered by MINI, customers can use 3D printing to create and order accessories to modify their MINI.\nImproved Materials- Several 3D printing processes offer materials that can withstand temperatures well above the average 105 degC sustained engine compartment temperatures such as SLS nylon and photo- cured polymers.\nRestoring Vintage Cars- 3D printing can also help restore vintage cars. Porsche is currently using SLM 3D printing for metal parts and SLS 3D printing for plastic parts and tooling, making a more extensive range of rare components available for collectors.","gobal_real_tfidf_jenks_class_8":"0","article_url":"https://www.manufacturingtomorrow.com/article/2019/08/3d-printing-a-game-changer-for-car-makers/13817/","top_kp":"0","article":"1","article_title":"3D

enter the North Building at McCormick Place, visitors to IMTS - The International Manufacturing Technology Show - must exit the Grand Concourse and pass through the new Additive Manufacturing Pavilion. Previously the technology has been featured in AMT\u0027s Emerging Technology Center as a cutting edge technology and then added to the Fabricating and Laser Pavilion. For IMTS 2016, additive manufacturing technology has earned a stand- alone spotlight at the show, which runs from Sept. 12- 17, 2016.\n\"Additive manufacturing is a reality for the industrial marketplace. It\u0027s not fully mature, but the technology has progressed far enough that if you\u0027re ignoring 3D printing at IMTS 2016, you\u0027re making a big mistake,\" advises David Burns, founder and principal of Global Business Advisory Services, LLC. \"Fortunately, within the IMTS Additive Manufacturing Pavilion, you\u0027ll find companies that offer a full suite of 3D products, and they\u0027re good at explaining the benefits.\"\nBurns well understands industrial manufacturing. IMTS 2016 will mark his 16th show. Before he started advising industrial companies, Burns co- founded and was President and COO of ExOne(tm), a leading provider of 3D printing machines, products and related services. Prior to ExOne, he was CEO for gear manufacturer Gleason Corporation.\nBurns says that technology advancements occur so rapidly that staying on top of new developments requires constant work. As it applies to 3D printing, developments include new metallurgies, new machines and a suite of design tools.\n\"Designing for 3D printing requires a completely different approach, as does integrating the power of 3D printing into your industrial manufacturing operation,\" he says.\nAs an example, Burns cites an aerospace part redesign where 3D printing reduced weight from 7 to 2 lbs. and offered better mechanical properties. Saving 5 lbs. per part over several parts adds up to serious fuel savings when you consider that American Airlines claims it will save $1.2 million in fuel per year by switching from 35- lb. paper manuals to a 1.5- lb. iPad.\nIn another example, 3D printing enables the integration of conformal cooling channels in the tooling for injection molded parts. The new design reduces cycle time, reduces reject rates associated with warping and offers a claimed productivity rate increase of 20 to 70 percent across several applications. In yet a third example, 3D printing enabled a design team to combine 18 parts into a single component that was 25 percent lighter and, more importantly, eliminated maintenance issues.\n\"If you\u0027re just trying to emulate an existing design, you need to expand your thinking to fully harness the power of 3D printing,\" says Burns. \"Savings and productivity improvements are going to come from ways you have yet to imagine.\"\nThe Additive Manufacturing Pavilion\n\"Additive manufacturing is incredibly dynamic, and in order to see new materials, new design ideas and new production techniques, you need to attend IMTS 2016,\" says Peter R. Eelman, Vice President - Exhibitions \u0026 Communications at AMT - The Association For Manufacturing Technology. Eelman emphasizes that the term additive manufacturing encompasses a collection of diverse technologies that includes material providers, 3D printers and associated equipment such as sintering furnaces, design and production software, scanners that capture points to create a parametric design and 3D printing service centers.\n\"The Additive Manufacturing Pavilion showcases essentially every component necessary for a manufacturing cell,\" he says. \"In addition, the technology has progressed so far that you\u0027ll also see it on the show floor. Several of the leading machine tool providers will demonstrate \u0027hybrid machines\u0027 that integrate 3D printing and traditional machine tool capabilities.\"\nPavilion exhibitors include ExOne, EOS of North America, 3D Systems, Statasys, HP, Optomec, Proto Labs, EnvisionTEC, Cideas, DM3D Technology, SCIAKY, 3rd Dimension Industrial 3D Printing, Hybrid Manufacturing Technologies, GPI Prototype \u0026 Manufacturing Services, Linear AMS - and more still being added.

That may be difficult to predict, but what 2018 holds for 3D printing is a bit easier to grasp since we\u0027ve reached out to a number of experts in the industry to get their input on what 2018 looks like for 3D printing.\nIncreased Adoption\nAccording to Michelle Bockman, global head of 3D printing commercial expansion and development for HP Inc., 3D printing for full- scale manufacturing will see increased adoption. This will take the following shape, according to Bockman: \"Industrial 3D printing will expand to a host of new countries, making it a truly global transformation. Advances in technology will significantly increase the speed, reliability and capability of 3D production. The scale economics of 3D printing will continue to improve, making digital manufacturing more cost- effective for more types of companies in more places. More companies will enter the 3D materials marketplace, helping to drive innovation, lower costs and increase materials diversity. Commercial applications of 3D printing will become more defined across major industries- automotive, medical, aerospace, consumer goods, heavy industry- making the digital industrial revolution a growing part of our everyday lives.\"\nScott Sevcik, VP of Manufacturing Solutions at Stratasys, echoed this point, with a specific emphasis on aerospace. \"Looking into 2018, we\u0027ll definitely see the acceleration of production part adoption in aerospace. Major OEMs have already industrialized FDM for interior applications - and this adoption is expanding both upstream and downstream,\" Sevcik said. \"This is seen as suppliers expand use of 3D printing for efficient, low volume and custom production - and as airlines and MROs leverage the technology for supply chain flexibility. You can already see that standards are currently being developed for industry- leading technologies and fused deposition modeling (FDM), while new simulation and analysis tools are coming online to aid designers in additive designs. As the year progresses, we\u0027ll see low- volume automotive catching up to aerospace with more and more parts in vehicles as well as broad adoption for Rapid Tooling on the automotive factory floor.\"\nGreg Mark, CEO of Markforged, reinforced the practical application of 3D printing technology, emphasizing its shift away from prototyping and towards end- use parts. In other words, the hype associated with 3D printing over the past few years is now coming to fruition. Markforged is known both for its carbon fiber and metal 3D printing technology.\n\"Now, we\u0027re finally living up to the promise and printing high- strength parts for real- world use cases,\" Mark said. \"With Markforged printers, companies are able to print carbon fiber- reinforced composites that are strong enough for the harshest applications, and metal 3D printing just got an order of magnitude more affordable,\" he added. \"Combined, these innovations dramatically expand the value proposition of 3D printing and are driving triple- digit growth fueled by rapid return on investment. Markforged customers typically see three- month return on investments for carbon fiber printers. The payback period is so fast that 31 percent of customers buy a second printer within the first year.\"\nVice President of Advanced Application Development at 3D Systems Patrick Dunne also believes that 3D printing will see increased adoption. \"In 2018, we will see businesses of all profiles across industries move toward deeper adoption of additive manufacturing (AM),\" Dunne said. \"The technology will drive small businesses in the sense that they can up- level their capabilities to those of a more established, mature business; this may introduce new levels of competition and new business models and market opportunity. Similarly, large companies will engage AM technologies earlier in the process, from the design phase, as capabilities to support the entire end- to- end workflow mature.\"\n3D printing won\u0027t be isolated to niche applications, according to Dunne. Instead, it will become a standard tool for \"many existing and novel production streams.\"\nImproved Design\nDuann Scott, responsible for Business Development and Strategy for Additive Manufacturing at Autodesk, saw major trends in design occurring next year. \"In 2018, we will start to see people really understand that design for additive manufacturing is key to it transforming from a very small part of manufacturing, to a substantial part of the economy,\" Scott said. \"Comparing an existing traditionally manufactured part to an AM replica is rarely going to be a financial win, but consolidating an entire assembly into a single AM part can massively reduce the manufacturing cost, completely compress the supply chain and improve the performance within a single design change. Once engineers (and their managers) start to realize this in the year ahead, we expect to see massive investment in design for AM.\"\nStratasys, too, is continuing work on its factory- appropriate 3D printing processes, the 3D Demonstrators unveiled in 2016.

The materials and models of 3D printer were expensive. Over the last few years, the costs have been coming down owing to the variations and improvements in the technologies of both the materials used and machines. This is making 3D printing cost- effective and more accessible in education and other industry.\nApplications of 3D Printing Technology\nThe impending uses of 3D printing are still being exposed. This article highlights some of the applications presently under way that are probable to be in general use first.\nEducation\n3D printing bridges the gap between ideas and image and allows for the creation of those images and ideas in the real 3- dimensional world. Today, many schools are integrating 3D printing methods into their programs. This is allowing students to make prototypes without any need for expensive tool and benefitting in better preparing for the future.\n3D printers are now generally found in public libraries and classrooms. For students, 3D printers are now available in universities so that they can use it in projects and classes. 3D printing technology is also revolutionizing STEM education. In addition, the graphic design students can effortlessly construct models with working multipart. The science students can study and create cross- sections of human body organs as well as other organic specimens. The students in chemistry can make 3D models of chemical compounds and molecules.\nMedicine\nOver the last few years, there have been many applications of 3D printing in the medicine world. These applications range from bioprinting to medical devices. 3D printing\u0027s versatility is exemplified by prosthetics. Formerly, it was expensive and difficult to create prosthetics that is suitable for a patient. But now with the help of 3D printing, calculated prosthetics can be printed and modeled at significantly lower cost.\nMetal orthopedic implants can be produced with 3D printing owing to its capabilities to create porous surfaces. These types of implants easily integrate with the natural bones of patient and allows them to grow into the implant. For pharmaceutical testing, 3D printed tissues have been developed as an ethical and cost- effective means of helping to validate safe dosages and identify the side effects of drugs.\nConstruction\n3D printing in construction offers technologies that use 3D printing as the foremost way for building fabrication or construction components. Technologies of 3D printing that are used at construction scale include powder bonding, extrusion, and additive welding. There is a wide array of applications for 3D printing in construction in the public, private, industrial, and commercial sectors. These technologies advantages in allowing more accuracy and complexity, greater functional integration, less waste, faster construction, and lower labor costs. In 2017, Russian city of Yaroslavl was the first city all over the globe where fully completed residential building was constructed.\nSince 1990s, concrete 3D printing is developing to be less expensive and faster way of constructing buildings and infrastructures. 3D printing is also used in producing architectural scale models, which enables a faster reversal of the scale model and increases the complexity and overall speed of the objects produced. As a revolutionary concept, the 3D printing technology is being studied for constructing celestial habitats, such as habitats on the Mars or Moon.\nArt and Jewelry\nTraditionally, jewelry makers did not get a chance to experiment with designs. But now 3D printers allow them to do so. The production of customized or unique individual pieces of jewelry can be fashioned at a much lower cost by using materials of 3D printing such as platinum, gold, and PLA (polylactic acid filament).\nThe artists all over the world are inspired by 3D printing technology, especially with metal 3D printing. 3D printing is allowing them to create beautiful intricate pieces. A famous and mysterious street artist, Banksy s one such artist whose work has been rendered from 2D to 3D using binding 3D printing.\nThese are just a few of the countless ways in which 3D printing technology is impacting our world. As the technology is evolving, the possibilities are growing and benefits are increasing. Thus, 3D printing is certainly a technology that a smart consumer would be conscious and ready to use as it matures and develops as a consumer product.\nAbout the Author\nAbhinav Chandrayan has worked in the Writing industry for 2 years, gaining experience in Media \u0026 Advertising and Market Research Industry.

Class":"0","top_articles":"68","kp_of_top_articles":"0","article_text":"Despite its success in prototyping, 3D printing is still very much the new kid on the block in manufacturing. This adolescent technology is still trying to find a niche amongst its older, faster siblings, like CNC machining and injection molding.\nThis state of affairs has raised many important but as- yet- unanswered questions:\nWill 3D printing unlock true on- demand manufacturing?\nHow do we move from metal rapid prototyping to metal additive manufacturing?\nAll of these questions share a common presumption: the future of 3D printing lies in production, whether that means creating finished parts or near net shapes.\nBut what if 3D printers have a different role to play on the shop floor?\n3D Printing in Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul\nThe CFM LEAP engine has become the posterchild for additive manufacturing, and its 3D- printed fuel nozzle is probably one of the most photographed parts ever made. The first engines were delivered to Airbus just a few months ago, which means that companies planning to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for these engines are already tooling up.\nIn a recent interview with Aviation Week, representatives of one such company, Rhinestahl, hinted at the possibility of using 3D- printed tools to maintain the LEAP engines.\n\"There are some tools where 3D printing is an optional method for manufacturing; I don\u0027t think there are many,\" said Dan Hudepohl, CFM56 and CFM LEAP technical program manager. \"I\u0027ve seen it on a few drawings where, if you have the capability, you can 3D print them, but you can also manufacture them with molds or however it calls out. They\u0027re starting to incorporate different manufacturing capabilities as things evolve.\"\n\"I\u0027m not sure about the line- maintenance fold, but there have been a handful of tools that have components that have a 3D printing option for the manufacturer,\" added engineering support leader Bob Dehner. \"The one thing I\u0027ve seen would be more use of aluminum and some plastics. Basically, both GE and [Safran Engine] are trying to make tools as light as possible to reduce the weight for ergonomic considerations.\"\nOf course, the advantages of 3D printing go beyond making more ergonomic tools. MRO companies can also use the technology to create spare parts on demand, enabling them to respond to emergency situations quickly without having to maintain large inventories of spare parts.\nThat\u0027s one reason for the interest in using additive manufacturing on the ISS, which could soon see an influx of 3D printers specifically designed for off- world use.\nThis strategy isn\u0027t just for aerospace applications, either. Audi has been using 3D printing in its tool design for some time now:\n\"[3D printing] enables us to produce parts faster and more cost- effectively,\" said Michael Breme, head of Audi tool design. \"For example, with a 3D printer we don\u0027t have any waste, like we would with metal cutting.\"\nThe cost of 3D printers remains one of the leading barriers to the widespread adoption of 3D printing in manufacturing, which explains why you\u0027re much more likely to find 3D printers in the aerospace sector than the automotive. However, the cost of the machines is less of an issue in MRO than it is for high volume production, since the former typically needs fewer machines than the latter.\nWhat do you think? Is MRO the best place for 3D printing in manufacturing?
